<br>
<P>
If you have been to our Country Store before, you know that this is one of the most fun events of the season.  It is a great opportunity for you to bring in plants, pots, associated items, or desserts to share with your fellow members.  (Bring in plants that you think other members would enjoy, unless you are looking forward to taking them back home yourself.  If you bring desserts, make certain that they are individually wrapped.)
</P>
<P>
Here is how it works.  First separate tables are set up for each category: Cacti, Succulents, Associated items, and Desserts.  Then we all buy tickets at five tickets for a dollar.  Members can use their tickets in whatever categories they like.  A board member for each table picks tickets, and each winning member in the order in which their ticket was selected gets their pick of what is on that table.  This is repeated until the Country Store is done or everyone dies laughing.
</P>
<P>
No MiniShow is planned for this meeting because of the Country Store.  Of course, if you have something of particular interest, you are welcome to bring it.
</P>
