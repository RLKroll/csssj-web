The flowers differ also.  As can be seen here one flower is very tidy with not a petal out of place.  The other is like most of the flowers with petals just open and looking pretty.  I had to take the photo of Miss <I>Elephantidens</I> looking so prim and proper.  Flowers also vary in color from light pink to a real red pink and some have stripes of red-pink and pink.  Great plants!!!  Every one should have several.  I guess I have only about 50 left but that makes for a good color show.</td></tr><tr><td align='right' colspan=2><img src='coryphanthaelephantidens2.jpg' width=320 height=240 hspace=80></td></tr></TABLE></center>");

fmart ("Past Prez Sez","","Ah, spring has sprung!  Warmer nights, warmer days.  Plants growing like mad - aphids invading.  Thrips appearing again to plague my <I>Sansevierias</I>.  Time to look over your beloved horticultural treasures.  New pots, new mixes.  Check for mealy bugs.  Brace yourself for the many, many shows and sales, tours, etc. in the coming months starting with the Monterey Bay Area C&SS (April 24 and 25) and NorCal in July.  These are just the central California activities.  You should see what the Southland has planned.<P></P>Our very important 35th Show and Sale - April 3 and 4 - is fast, fast, fast approaching.  I encourage you all to show your plants.  The Novice class is a great starting point.  New exhibitors can learn the &quot;ropes&quot; in a low-pressure, friendly atmosphere and get show bucks, too.  It is important to show the public the joys of our hobby and hopefully they will buy lots of plants and pottery.</P><P>The revenue from our Show and Sale is a primary source of funds for club activities throughout the rest of the year.  It is so very important that we make this event successful to make possible all of the other programs that we enjoy.  Not to mention that being the people who make the Show and Sale a success is so much fun!");
