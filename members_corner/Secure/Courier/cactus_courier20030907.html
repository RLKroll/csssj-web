<B class="leadhead">Dean Kelch - <br>Safari to the Drakensbergs</B><br>
<P>
This past winter, Dean Kelch, our presenter this month, journeyed to eastern South Africa.  He visited, among other areas, the famous Drakensberg Mountains.  This region of high peaks is noted for its many exciting endemic plants.
</P>
<P>
Dean, a post-doctoral fellow at U.C. Berkeley, is well known as an excellent speaker and photographer - a great accompaniment to his vast horticultural knowledge.  We expect him to bring plants to tempt our pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kelch was accompanied on this trek by Walter Teague.  Mr. Teague is a frequent speaker at our meetings, too.  Their experiences include several road tales - including a near carjacking - as well as horticultural discoveries.

fmart ("Grower's Garden","Elton Roberts","<TABLE cellpadding=17><tr><td>From Mexico in the state of Michoacan we have <I>Coryphantha elephantiden</I>s.  With flowers to about 3 inches in diameter, <I>C. elephantidens</I> makes a right big splash of color.  Then when you multiply that by 100 plants and 2/3 are in bloom it is quite a show.  I find that <I>Coryphanthas</I> in the most part are quite easy to grow.  Just make sure that there is good drainage.  Do not add sand to the soil as that makes the soil hold water.  I also see that all of them can take temperatures to 32 degrees with out any problems as long as they are dry.</td><td><img src='coryphanthaelephantidens.jpg' width=320 height=240></td></tr><tr><td> &nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><img src='echinocereusmaritimus.jpg' width=320 height=240></td><td><I>Echinocereus maritimus</I> comes from mostly the northern half of Baja California.  There is the regular <I>E. maritimus v. maritimus</I> and a plant with heavier spines given the variety name of <I>hancockii</I>. Variety <I>hancockii</I> comes from the most southern part of the range.  For me the plant does not bloom in profusion but a flower or two at a time.  Being from near the coast of Baja, it does not seem to like the heat and for me goes dormant in the heat of summer.  It is when the cooler nights come again that it blooms.</td></tr></TABLE>");

fmart ("What's Bugging You ","Jim Daniel","MORDIDA or in Spanish &quot;the Little Bite&quot;.  It can give you a chance to practice your negotiating skills.  The first price is always too high.  I used to carry two cans of Spam in the back of the truck, three dollars in my left shirt pocket and another in my right trousers pocket.</P><P>One time when going through Monterey Mexico, it was pouring rain.  The streets were narrow, the one way signs were on the second floor, and the inside of my windshield was fogged up.  A bus passed me bound for Ciudad Victoria, which was in the direction I was headed.  I got on his tail and was making good headway until we passed a policeman directing traffic at an intersection.  He blew his whistle several times, which means stop in Mexico.  I stepped on the gas to keep up with the bus.  (A traffic cop has no transportation except maybe a bicycle.)  He could never catch me.  A couple of blocks later, here he came on a motorcycle.  I stopped then.  He said I was doing 20 Kilometers (12 Miles) an hour and it was a school zone.  Never mind that there were no students at night.  Never mind that I was following a bus that was not speeding.  The fine was payable on the spot and it was $20.00.  I negotiated him down to $3.00.  We parted company, both feeling pretty good about ourselves.  Three dollars was the average policeman's wage in Mexico at the time.</P><P>The cans of Spam were for the Inspectors when crossing the border.  The rule of thumb is one can of Spam per inspector per load of Cactus.</P><br><P><center>(To be continued . . .)</center>");
