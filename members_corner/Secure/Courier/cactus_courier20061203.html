<P>
This year's Holiday Banquet will be held on December 3, 2006, from 11:00am to 4:00pm at Harry's Hoffbrau.  The restaurant is located at 390 Saratoga Avenue near Kiely Boulevard.  Their number is 408-243-0434.

</P>
<P>
Everyone who brings a plant puts it on the center table for the plant exchange.  A club officer will select the best plant which will be added to the auction plants.  The person who brought that plant is the first to select from the exchange.  Whoever brought the plant the first person picked picks next, and so forth until all the plants have been taken.  When all the plants are gone, the last person selects a plant from the gift plants.
</P>
<P>
There will be two categories of plants for the auction: plants under $20 and plants over $20.  For the plants under $20 the first person bidding $20 will get the plant.  The auction in this area will be silent; there will be a card next to the plant in which people will bid on the plant.  When time is up, only the top three bidders will be able to bid on the plant. Again the first person to bid $20 will get the plant.  This will be explained at the dinner so don't worry if you don't understand it now.  The plants over $20 will be handled the same way; only on both categories there will be a minimum bid that will be listed and bidding will start from the minimum bid.  Hopefully these changes will speed along the process and bidding.
</P>
<P>
Members who renew at or before the December meeting will participate in a special plant raffle.

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado","Competitions are a funny thing.   Sometimes just making the decision to compete is a win in it's self.  First, second, or third place aren't always the goal: showing can be the goal.  Having fun should always be the ultimate goal.</P><P>When I was growing up, my parents were competitive ballroom dancers.  We used to go to events at least once a month.  My parents were the most gorgeous and the most talented of all of the dancers.  We kids couldn't wait to see them out on the floor swirling around to the music.  Two years ago my niece got married and my parents were out on the dance floor once again.  We kids and grandkids and great-grandkids circled around them, and, for a moment, it was as if time had reversed and they were young and the center of our worlds once again.</P><P>I come from a competitive family.  I've seen uncles bet on just about anything from card games to which one of them could do the most pull-ups on our swing set.  (They broke the swing set!)  I've seen my grandparents sit at a table for three days playing a game of Monopoly.  I've entered plants at the fair and even won the grand prize one year.  (It was a throw blanket that is in my front-room on a chair.) </P><P>So, why haven't I ever entered a plant in our show?  After many years of soul searching, I have discovered a sad thing about myself.  I have discovered that I am a poor sport.  I don't understand why I don't always win first place, and I get down right hard to live with when I do win.  All in all, it's not much fun either way for me.</P><P>I'm hoping that one day I will be able to compete just for the fun of the competition, but I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for this to happen.  So I have set a goal for myself:  I will be there to share with my friends their wins and their losses.  I will try my best to help make all of our shows a success.  And most of all, I will try to have fun when I'm doing it.");

fmart ("Prez Sez'","Bill Munkacsy","This is my last president message.  It has been a pleasure to serve you and the club.  I have had a lot of help from many including the great help from our current board with great and novel ideas on a number of subjects.  And of course, the constant reminders and help from Bill Kurtz.  His addition as a permanent board emeritus member will greatly aid the club progress.  Things have moved along relative smoothly with good progress during my tenure.  I have seen the progression of the show and sale to prominence.  Revenues and success has greatly improved, and we have added a fall sale that also looks like a success.  Our treasury has increased to a safe liquidity level allowing for future novel events and activities to be monetarily possible.  Finally, I have noticed a warm and friendly atmosphere occurring throughout the members of our club promoting the hobby and fun times.  I am sure our next board will be able to do even more and better with novel ideas etc;. Again thanks to all for your past and continuing support");
