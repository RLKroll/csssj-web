<br>
<P>
If you have been to our Country Store before, you know that this is one of the most fun events of the season.  It is a great opportunity for you to bring in plants, pots, associated items, or desserts to share with your fellow members.  (Bring in plants that you think other members would enjoy, unless you are looking forward to taking them back home yourself.  If you bring desserts, make certain that they are individually wrapped.)
</P>
<P>
Here is how it works.  First separate tables are set up for each category, Cacti, Succulents, Associated Items, and Desserts.  Then we all buy tickets at five tickets for a dollar.  Members can use their tickets in whatever categories they like.  A board member for each table picks tickets, and each winning member in the order in which their ticket was selected gets his or her pick of what is on that table.  This is repeated until the Country Store is done or everyone dies laughing.
</P>
<P>
No MiniShow is planned for this meeting because of the Country Store.  Of course, if you have something of particular interest, you are welcome to bring it.
</P>

fmart ("Prez Sez'","Bill Munkacsy"," This is an exciting time of year.  Plants are growing and activities are happening.  The NORCAL Show and Sale was just completed and again a very successful effort and sale took place. Richard Deming won many prizes showing his plants in the advanced category.  Things are shaping up nicely for the Fall Show and Sale.  A number of new vendors will be present.  This is going to be a fun show.  Everyone showing plants will create their special area and be judged by the visitors to the show.</P><P>This next meeting is one of the most fun of the year especially for new or beginning members.  It is the country store.  There will be nice items available.  I am personally bringing in a lot of plants.  These items are to be had for the cheap price of a raffle ticket.  It is a must for all the members to participate, and fun will be had by all.");

fmart ("NORCAL Show and Sale 2006","Cecelia Pelicon","Way over forty years ago, a fellow teacher gave me her modest succulent collection, died a few days later, and left me a legacy of life-long addiction to the wonderful world of collecting cactus and succulents.  One &quot;high&quot; that happens every year is the Cactus and Succulent Show and Sale, and I've been there every year, involved one way or another.  This is a mini impression of this NORCAL Show and Sale, 2006.</P><P>The sale was huge.  Venders, venders everywhere, 23 total.  Five potters had unique pots each a different style.  Brand new venders from Arizona, Sticky Situation, selling many premium large plants.  Petra Crist selling rare, mature caudiciforms from Africa.  Returnees selling designer dish gardens from Plantopia, rare seedlings from Cactus Specialties, botanical oddities from Jon Dixon.  All kinds and sizes and colors from California Succulents, even some Bromeliads from Marilyn Moyer.  And more, deliciously more.</P><P>The Show was mesmerizing.  So many visually flawless plants, impeccably groomed, staged with obvious love and pride.  The owners were really growers of distinction.  Was any one plant more worthy than the others to get Best-in-Show?  Definitely debatable!</P><P>My favorite succulent was Jon Dixon's <I>Purdees 55</I>, a <I>Sempervivum</I> of such class.  And then there was Mark Muradian's crested cactus, an enormous crest that crested itself into a conical pyramid.</P><P>What a show!  Awed by all!");

It is approximately 7 ft. tall  by 4 ft. wide.</P><P>It's in a fairly shaded area and never bloomed there, but the starts I took from it and put in pots bloom every year with beautiful large blooms on summer nights.</P><P>If any of your members are interested in this plant, either for dozens of cuttings or the plant as a whole (have no idea how you'd move that large of a plant---but it would be a &quot;You dig and haul&quot;)  please contact me by phone (408) 238-4098 (after noon any day) or e-mail me at marylegs@sbcglobal.net.</P><P>Mary Zeller","","","","","CSSSJ Classified","Want to sell or trade plants, pots, equipment, or services?
