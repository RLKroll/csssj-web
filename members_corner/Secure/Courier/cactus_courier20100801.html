Habitat home of <I>Mammillaria capensis</I> is in the southern portion of Baja California.  It grows at low elevations near the Pacific ocean and a bit in land.  The plant makes small clumps of up to 10+ heads.  The body is to 3.5 cm across and to about 20 to 25 cm tall.  In cultivation, the plant does not get much bigger than that.  I have several old plants, and they are from 8 to 10 headed and 26 cm tall.</P><P><I>Mammillaria capensis</I> is one of those plants that you do not want on the front edge of the bench.  They are just too friendly, especially to any one wearing a sweater.  Like most hooked-spined plants, they like to hang on to you if they get a chance.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='mammillaria capensis pl.jpg' width=320 height=280 hspace=17 align='right'><br><br>Flowers are to 2.5 cm across and long.  The color is white to off white with pink.  It is said that a lot of plants in cultivation have only white flowers.  As you can see, mine have a good amount of pink in them also.  I have received many plants where the flower color does not conform to the description.  After being given new soil and fed several times, the flower color then matches the description.  In talking to many people whether they feed their plants, the answer is 93% no.</td></tr></TABLE>");

Within a few years, it grew into a large specimen plant and began gathering its strength.  Visitors always remarked on how impressed they were with this guardian of the back yard.  Patiently we waited for it to flower; each year I looked in vain for some change.   Finally this year, on April 15, we noticed a large &quot;asparagus stalk&quot; poking up from the top - it's happening!  The flower stalk grew nearly a foot per day in April, and it was over 30 feet tall by the end of May.  Only now, in late July, are the flowers starting to open.  It should be quite a sight in the weeks to come as it reaches its full glory. Here are two pictures, one taken 8 days after the stalk began to appear and one this week as the first flowers open.</td></tr></TABLE>");

Warren was hospitalized Monday after the incident and released Tuesday, said his spokesman, A. Larry Ross.  Warren is expected to make a full recovery, Ross said.</P><P>&quot;My eyes were severely burned by a toxic poison,&quot; Warren wrote in a Twitter message Thursday morning. &quot;Hospitalized Mon. Excruciating pain. Now home. Pray my sight loss is restored.&quot;  Though the pain was initially so intense that Warren could not open his eyes on Monday, he was seeing well enough Thursday to send the Tweet himself, Ross said. &quot;The pain was excruciating - 12 on a scale of 1 through 10,&quot; Ross said. &quot;It's now down to an 8.&quot;</P><P>Warren was pruning shrubs in the yard of his Southern California home when he wiped his eyes after picking up leaves from a firestick plant, Ross said.  The sap of the firestick is toxic and can cause skin irritation and temporary blindness if it comes in contact with the skin or eyes, according to the website <a href='http://www.gardenguides.com/116626-grow-firestick-succulent-plant.html' target='blanka'>gardenguides.com</a>.  The firestick is a succulent with spiky orange branches.</P><P>&quot;A doctor put protective contacts on my corneas as bandages during the healing,&quot; Warren said in another Tweet on Thursday. &quot;I am NOT blind.&quot;</P><P>The firestick is found around the world, Ross said, and grows well in Southern California.  &quot;Pastor Rick, an avid gardener, purchased it locally himself,&quot; Ross said.</P><P>From CNN Religion blog  <a href='http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/22/pastor-rick-warren-hospitalized-after-eyes-burned/' target='blanka'>http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/22/pastor-rick-warren-hospitalized-after-eyes-burned/</a></P><P>When working with Euphorbias, use latex or neoprene gloves and eye protection.
