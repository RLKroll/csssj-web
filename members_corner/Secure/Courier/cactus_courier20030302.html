Dean Kelch and Walter Teague traveled to South Africa and visited the Western Cape Province.  (Dean Kelch is the Vice President of the San Francisco Cactus Society and a post-doctoral fellow associated with U.C. Berkeley.)  Mr. Kelch will be presenting a slide show of <I>Crassula, Tylecodon, Conophytum, Adromischus, Hawathia</I>, and desert growing bulbs photographed in their natural habitat.

<B>by Paul Long</B>
<P>
Margaret Grimm was taken from us on Jan 10, 2003.  She, and her Husband, Bob (Robert), joined the CSSSJ in July, 1971.  Margaret was on the Board of Directors for many years beginning most recently in 1985. She served the Society quietly in the background, being the distributor of the Newsletter for many years.  The copies were delivered to her home, and she would collate them and address the copies, then secure them and deliver them to the Post Office.  She did this month after month, and year after year, quietly doing this necessary job for us.  As a Board member, it was often her job to "keep the peace" when the discussions became heated, and we thank her for that and all she did for the CSSSJ.  The Grimms were made Life Members for the many contributions that she and Bob made over many years.  Even though I didn't keep too close to her after she became less active in the Club, I have always had a soft spot in my heart for her, and I will miss her.

fmart ("New Cactus Found","Bill Munkacsy","Contact Elton Roberts (cactus@netfeed.com) for info and pictures of a new cactus (unlike any other) discovered in Mexico.  Bill Kurtz discussed this with Brian Kemble who considers it to be a groundbreaking discovery.  We hope to have more information about this plant in the future.");


fmart ("OAKLAND CLUB MOVES TO EAST BAY","Bill Munkacsy","The Cactus and Succulent Society of California in an attempt to increase interest in the hobby and increase membership size has decided to move their club to the East Bay.  This should attract interest primarily in Dublin, Danville, Walnut Creek, Concord, Pleasanton, San Ramon, and Livermore along with the entire eastern suburb area.  The new club is looking for members and can use any and all help it can get.  At this point it is temporarily meeting at Jim and Diane Hess's house in Dublin: 11374 Rampart Drive, Dublin CA.  A permanent meeting location is being researched as is an East Bay location for an annual show and sale.  So far dead ends abound and help is needed.  The club plans regular meetings each month the third Thursday at 7pm with interesting and novel speakers.  If you have any questions, contact Bill Munkacsy at 925-935-5213.");

fmart ("What's Bugging You","Jim Daniel","We have had a mild winter in Sunnyvale.  Our coldest temperature was 34 degrees Fahrenheit.  No frost damage at all!  The Tulip Magnolias and Almond trees are in full bloom.  Spring must be right around the corner.  Now that you have the Rose bushes pruned, it is time to get your spring crop of Cactus ready for planting.  Make your cuttings now.  Pot them up in fresh soil, stand back and watch them root.</P><P>Spring is also the time for weeds to grow.  You may not have noticed, but a new crop is up and growing.  You can hand pull them, not an easy job for an old fat man.  Spray with a herbicide such as Roundup.  It comes two ways; as a mixed solution ready to use, about $20.00 per gallon, or a Chemical that you mix with nine parts water about $90.00 per gallon.  It is available from Orchard Supply Hardware.  It will kill all most any plant that you spray it on, so have a care.");

fmart ("Get ready.  Get set.  Show!!!","Bill Kurtz","Let's not leave the show to the vendors.  Let's all try to have something for the show.  We need more participation in the Novice class.  They don't have to be in fancy containers with professional presentations.  Nice plants in clean pots will add immesurably to the success and quality of our show.    Don't forget about the Show Bucks and the special bonus Show Bucks for first-time exhibitors.</P><P>Here is a reminder of some of the details from last month's Courier:<UL type='circle'><li> Entering is not very hard.  We will have the rules, category lists, and entry forms at the next two meetings.  If you are confused about what to do, just ask around.  Many of us have shown before and would love to lend a hand to newcomers.  Showing is fun, and you can learn a lot about your plants from the judges if you show.<br><br></li><li>We will be awarding some very nice pottery to the winners this year.<br><br></li><li>We will be holding a special raffle for club members who are competing (showing one or more plants) in our show for the first time.  More details will appear in next month's Courier.<br><br></li><li>If you decide to enter plants in the show, you must bring them in to the show area between 5:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Friday, April 4th (no exceptions!).  You can pick them up after the show closes on Sunday, April 6th, after 5:00 p.m.<br><br></li><li>If you're a club member attending the show and sale, note that we put on a potluck/barbecue on both Saturday and Sunday.  The club provides the meat (hamburgers, hot-dogs, chicken) and the attendees bring a potluck dish to share.<br><br></li></UL>");

fmart ("Past Prez Sez","Bill Kurtz","We need copies of past rosters, Couriers, Show programs, and advertising for the historical section of our club's library.  (Copies are fine, if you want to keep the original.)  In particular, I would like to have a copy of the 1998 club roster.</P><P>I echo Paul's sentiments regarding the value to our organization and our sense of loss of Margaret Grimm.  Margaret was the one who always out front in club affairs, while Bob was in the background quietly going about hybridizing Echeveria and other succulent plants of which he was a master.  I will be bringing to the March meeting a large volume of color photos including many hybridized by Bob.");
