<P>
An interest in succulent plants was a natural extension of Mr. Heiple's background in Geology.   His professional excursions to geological sites have given him an opportunity to observe succulent plants in several of their natural habitats.  Additionally, he has built gardens in three disparate climates, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and California.
</P>
<P>
How could someone who makes his profession studying rocks resist Mesembs, the plants that mimic rocks?  For Paul Heiple, the attraction proved irresistible.   In our November meeting, he will share with us his enthusiasm for these mimicry plants.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, he will bring some of these plants he has grown from seed for sale to our members.</P>

fmart ("Prez Sez'","Bill Munkacsy","We will be adding a classified section to list plants or plant items for sale or plants wanted or happy birthday wishes. It will be free, but be printed under editor's scrutiny and guidelines similar to ebay.  Non-plant and non-club related items like someone advertising their business will be prohibited.  (Note: vendors may advertise for free but would be expected to give a donation to the club.)</P><P>Club dues will be $20 single $25 family starting Jan 1, 2006.  We would like those who would be interested in receiving their courier online to voice this wish to Rich Kroll.  If he can accomplish this, he will try to do so.  This would save the club roughly $5 a year for each member in postage, which we could consider reimbursing in some way like a free plant etc. </P><P>Hours for our next Show and Sale on Sunday will be from 10am to 4pm.  We will not be using the credit card machine anymore due to excessive use charges.  At our sale, we will take only cash and check.</P><P>For the Christmas auction, there again will be two categories of plants: plants under $20 and plants over $20.  For the plants under $20 the first person bidding $20 will get the plant.  The auction in this area will be silent; there will be a card next to the plant in which people will bid on the plant.  When time is up, only the top three bidders will be able to bid on the plant. Again the first person to bid $20 will get the plant.  This will be explained at the Christmas dinner so don't worry if you don't understand it now.  The plants over $20 will be handled the same way; only on both categories there will be a minimum bid that will be listed and bidding will start from the minimum bid. Hopefully these changes will speed along the process and bidding.");

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado"," There comes a time in all of our lives when we just have to throw in the towel and give up.  I'm not suggesting that a great deal of thought and sweat shouldn't go into the project before we give up, but sometimes we just have to say that enough is enough.  I say this only because there are just some things that are beyond our control.</P><P>I have one plant that I have been struggling with for several years.  I have babied it and repotted it and nursed it in ways that I wouldn't even have dreamed of.  And yet, there it sits, just defying me at every turn.  This isn't a $100.00 plant.  It doesn't have any real value other than that I have a stubborn streak that just doesn't want to give up.</P><P>My friend Rose has a little rock garden on her desk that came from some place like Home Depot.  It couldn't have cost more than a couple of bucks.  It has been totally dead for at least five years, and yet she still has it sitting on her desk.</P><P>There is a place in my mom's garden that has never been able to sustain any kind of life.  She has tried every kind of plant known to man and it just won't grow anything.  &quot;Is it the soil?&quot;  No, she has dug it up half way to China and put in good rich soil.  &quot;Is it the amount of lighting in that section?&quot;  No, it seems to be the same as everywhere else.  &quot;Is it the male dog that she has in her household?&quot;  Maybe.</P><P>And still we plod along, trying to overcome the realities of life.  There are something's that are just out of our control and yet we will still try to control them.</P><P>I'm going to give that plant one last chance.");

There is a question as to if this is a form called <I>E. poselgerianus</I>, which is now thought to be a giant form of <I>E berlandieri</I>.  For years I had this plant growing in the ground, but finally got tired of trying to keep weeds out of it. This plant is growing in a pot with a Saguaro.  The flowers are up to 13 cm (5&quot;) inches across.  I have no problem in growing the plant in the ground pots or hangers.  They do make a good hanger.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><br><br>The flowers of <I>E. ctenoides</I> are to 10 to 12 cm (4&quot; to 4.74&quot;) across.  That is depending on how much the flowers open.  I have had no problems with this plant except every one wanting one when they see it in bloom.  I give it my regular soil mix and water it along with the rest of the plants in the house it is in.  It comes from Southern Texas and adjacent Mexico.  It had not been seen in collections very much for some reason.  Maybe because it had been many times confused with <I>E. dasyacantha</I>.</td><td valign='top'><TABLE><tr><td><img src='echinocereus ctenoides sb1536b.jpg' width=320 height=240 hspace=0></td></tr><tr><td align='center'><font size=-2 color='#6699CC'><I>Echinocereus ctenoides SB1536</I></font></td valign='top'></tr></TABLE></td></tr></TABLE></center>");
