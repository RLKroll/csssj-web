Mark Muradian is a third-generation farmer in the San Joaquin valley.  This affords him the benefit of large-scale farming equipment to do his landscaping.  The result is desert tableaus on a grand scale.  His slide show is well worth the watching, if for no other reason than to marvel at the magnitude of his efforts.

fmart ("What's Bugging You ","Jim Daniel","<center>(Continued from last month.)</center></P><P>When passing through Torreon one afternoon, pulling my camp trailer behind me, I made a stop then crossed the intersection.  I almost made it.  A young Mexican driving a beat up old car hit the back of the trailer.  He got out of his vehicle and said for $20.00 he would forget the accident.  He would forget it?  He was the cause of the fender bender, and I would not pay him for running into me.  The Police arrived and took us both to the Station House.  In Mexico, both parties are under arrest until all claims are settled.  After a good four hours, my insurance company agreed to settle and the Police released me.  I asked the Policeman why they allowed Junky cars on the roads.  He replied that if all the unsafe autos were removed from the roads, there would be no cars on the roads of Mexico.  As a parting shot, they fined me $20.00 for running the arterial stop sign at the intersection.  I said I stopped even though there was no stop sign there.  The policeman said there used to be a stop sign there, but a drunk had knocked it down 20 years before.  Everyone in town knew that there was supposed to be a stop sign there.  It brightened up my day when my Mexican insurance paid for the repairs on my camp trailer.");
