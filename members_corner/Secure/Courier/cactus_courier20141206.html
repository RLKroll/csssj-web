This year's Holiday Banquet will be held on Saturday, December 6, 2014, from 11:00am to 3:00pm at Harry's Hofbrau.  The restaurant is located at 390 Saratoga Avenue near Kiely Boulevard.  Their number is 408-243-0434.

Everyone who brings a plant puts it on the center table for the plant exchange.  A club officer will select the best plant which will be added to the auction plants.  The person who brought that plant is the first to select from the exchange.  Whoever brought the plant the first person picked picks next, and so forth until all the plants have been taken.  When all the plants are gone, the last person selects a plant from the gift plants.
</P>
<P>
There will be two categories of plants for the auction: plants under $20 and plants over $20.  For the plants under $20 the first person bidding $20 will get the plant.  The auction in this area will be silent; there will be a card next to the plant in which people will bid on the plant.  When time is up, only the top three bidders will be able to bid on the plant. Again the first person to bid $20 will get the plant.  The plants over $20 will be handled the same way; only on both categories there will be a minimum bid that will be listed and bidding will start from the minimum bid.  Members can bring in their own plants for the auction.  If you are interested, contact Bill Munkacsy at 925-935-5213. (See article on the next page for details.)
</P>
<P>
Members who renew at or before the December meeting will participate in a special plant raffle.

fmart ("Christmas Auction","Bill Munkacsy","Hi Everyone.</P><P>We will be having our Christmas Extravaganza party Saturday December 6.  Part of the celebration is our Christmas auction consisting of plant and plant related materials.  During the Christmas party we do NOT have a feature where you can just buy plants for a fixed price; we leave that to our two shows.  But what we do have is two ways for you to pick up quality plants at prices YOU want to pay:<OL><li>We have a portion of the auction set aside for plants $20 and under.  Any one member can bring 10 plants to put in this category.  In this area of the auction you can bid up to $20 for a plant.  The first person bidding $20 gets the plant.  Hint: if you are looking for something special get here early and bid $20 and get the prize before someone else does.<br><br>We recommend setting a minimum bid on plants.  Consigners need to put on the card the bare minimum they will take for the plant.  We start the bidding there.  We will NOT waive the minimum or change it once it is established. The item will not sell if the minimum is not obtained; it will be put aside until after the auction and then sold if a buyer is willing to pay the minimum.  There will be no direct sales by consigners to buyers at any time during or after the party in the facility.  Consigners donate a 30% fee to the club for each item sold, and sales tax will be charged buyers in accordance with California law.  Karla and Judy are lined up to keep records of the sales and do the bookwork<br><br></li><li>The other portion of the auction is a standard auction with no maximum price.  Any one member can bring 10 plants to put in this part of the auction.  Plants will be sold to the highest bidder.  Again a minimum bid is recommended to be placed on each item in this category by the consigner, and the auction will be carried out starting with this price. Again rules of the auction will be followed as outlined above.  Plants that sell for $100 or more will be charged a 20% donation fee to the club for each item sold.</OL><P>We all would appreciate your help and tolerance during the auction.  We go through a large amount of plants in a short while, and we want to give everyone a fair and equal chance at selling their plants.");

fmart ("Grower's Garden","Elton Roberts","<center><TABLE width='90%'><tr><td valign='top'>Many people do not like cactus because of the spines.  I think that if you removed all spines from cactus we would have some boring looking plants.  Some years ago, my mom was in an accident and had to stay here.  It was in November-January, so it was this time of year.  Every day she would go out to kill time in the hothouses.  I noticed that she would stay longer and longer.  One day she came in and said, &quot;I now see why you grow cactus; you always have something to look at.  My lilies come up in the spring, and I have a green stalk of green leaves.  In time, that throws flowers, and I have wonderful color to enjoy.  Soon, all I have is a stalk again.  In a short time, that starts to die.  Then all I have is a dead stalk of dead leaves.  You have wonderful things to look at all year.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='coryphantha weredermanniana.jpg' width=400 height=340 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right'><br><I>Coryphantha weredermanniana</I> starts out life with no central spines.  A lot of plants start out with the central spines missing. The central spines and some other spines start growing as the plant matures or gets old enough to throw flowers.  It is a right of passage so to say.  Melocactus will not bloom until they get mature enough to get the cephalium.  In some plants, getting mature enough to bloom can take years.  It is the same with the plants that do not bloom until they throw their adult spination.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='thelocactus heterchromus sps.jpg' width=400 height=340 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left'><br><I>Thelocactus heterochromus</I> does not belong to the above mentioned plants.  It starts life with spines that look like spines on mature plant.  It is just that they are not hefty in the smaller stages.  As the plant grows, it throws a bit stronger spines until it gets like the ones in the photos.  The spines are to 3.5 cm long and 3 mm in diameter.  On the 30 year old parent plants, the longest spines are not to much longer.  They are 4.5 to 5 cm long and 3 mm in diameter.  I really like the colors of the spines as there are horn, pink, yellow, off white and ruby red.  Some plants have all colors of spines, and others have only yellow or horn with some off white or pink thrown in.  The ruby red spines will, in time, fade and not be so bright red which is a shame.  The plants are about 5 or 6 years old 8 cm in diameter and have been blooming for 4 years.<br><center><img src='thelocactus heterochromus.jpg' width=400 height=340 hspace=17 vspace=17><img src='blank.gif' width=50 height=1></center></td></tr></TABLE></center>");
