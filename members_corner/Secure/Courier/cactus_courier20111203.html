This year's Holiday Banquet will be held on Saturday, December 3, 2011, from 11:00am to 3:00pm at Harry's Hofbrau.  The restaurant is located at 390 Saratoga Avenue near Kiely Boulevard.  Their number is 408-243-0434.

</P>
<P>
Everyone who brings a plant puts it on the center table for the plant exchange.  A club officer will select the best plant which will be added to the auction plants.  The person who brought that plant is the first to select from the exchange.  Whoever brought the plant the first person picked picks next, and so forth until all the plants have been taken.  When all the plants are gone, the last person selects a plant from the gift plants.
</P>
<P>
There will be two categories of plants for the auction: plants under $20 and plants over $20.  For the plants under $20 the first person bidding $20 will get the plant.  The auction in this area will be silent; there will be a card next to the plant in which people will bid on the plant.  When time is up, only the top three bidders will be able to bid on the plant. Again the first person to bid $20 will get the plant.  This will be explained at the dinner so don't worry if you don't understand it now.  The plants over $20 will be handled the same way; only on both categories there will be a minimum bid that will be listed and bidding will start from the minimum bid.  Members can bring in their own plants for the auction.  If you are interested, contact Bill Munkacsy at 925-935-5213.
</P>
<P>
Members who renew at or before the December meeting will participate in a special plant raffle.

fmart ("Editor's Note","Rich Kroll","The November issue of the Cactus Courier marked my ten-year anniversary as the newsletter editor.  So, it occurred to me that I might share some of my thoughts about that decade.</P><P>I am not a phantom.  I do exist.  The reason you have not seen me at meetings has more to do with health issues than with the state of my enthusiasm for cacti and succulents.  I may be limited physically, but that does not mean that my interest has waned.  I keep involved by editing this newsletter and by managing the club's web site.</P><P>How has this club changed over the past ten years?</P><P>There has always been a small central cadre of enthusiasts who have been the driving force in keeping the organization alive and growing.  What has changed is the individuals that make up that group and their affect on its dynamics.  I have often wished that this was not the character of our club and that more members would want to take active participation in its development and direction.  But things are the way they are, and there are things that cannot be changed; they only can be accepted.  At least, our club has attracted enough people who will take the initiative so that it does thrive.  That is good enough for me.</P><P>Some dear people who were mainstays of this club have passed away.  Others have moved away.  Many of them remain dear to my heart and I believe to the hearts of others who were privileged to know them, while they graced us with their knowledge and ebullience.</P><P>I have always been amazed by how much our members know about plants in general and succulents in particular.  I am still learning from them and probably will for as long as I am here.  By sharing, we have all enriched each others lives and enhanced our appreciation for the plants that bring us together.</P><P>Somehow, everything gets done no matter what obstacles are thrust in our path.  People step up to fill voids, and the club carries on.  I hope that trend continues into the future.");

It has been listed as a variety of <I>A. myriostigma</I> for quite a few years.  Now I see that E.F. Anderson just ignores the name, and it is swallowed up by <I>A. myriostigma</I>.  Most people consider <I>A. coahuilense</I> to be a hard plant to grow right along with <I>A. asterias</I>.  It seems like to me that it is more prone to rot than <I>A. myriostigma</I>.   <I>A. coahuilensis</I> grows a lot slower than some of the other Astrophytums.
