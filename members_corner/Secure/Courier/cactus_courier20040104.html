<P>
Well known for his plant staging techniques in Southern California, Larry Grammer will be providing us with insights into his preparation methodology.  Larry presented this program at NORCAL to rave reviews.  This could be the last chance in a long time for us to learn about Mr. Grammer's staging techniques.
</P>
<P>
He will be bringing pots and plants for demonstration purposes.  Next month, Naomi Bloss and Rowena Southwell will conduct hands-on exercises for aspiring stagers where you can apply the lessons learned in Mr. Grammer's presentation and demonstrations.<br><br><br><br>

This <I>Escobaria</I> flower is one of the flowers that is really beautiful that I had not noticed so much before.  I have another <I>Escobaria</I> that throws with flowers that are about 5 cm in diameter and it is easier to see and enjoy the flowers.  This flower is about 3 cm across.  I really like the wind flower look.  I have noticed that most people pass over the <I>Escobaria</I> group when at sales.  Up by the Grand Canyon, in one area of about 25 x 25 meters square, if you did not know better you would swear there is 28 to 32 varieties of <I>E. vivipara</I>.  There are plants with spine colors of all white on down to plants with almost all black spines.  There are some with the most striking honey colored spines.  You should see the ones with mahogany colored spines.  It is a great place to study the plants.</P><P>Give them a fast draining soil and for best growing a pH of around 6.  I have several plants growing outside and they have taken every thing Mother Nature has thrown at them.</td></tr><tr><td>From Argentina comes <I>Gymnocalycium valnicekianum</I>.  Here is another great flower, I just love the reddish center.  The plant body is a dark grass green and is smooth.  The spines make it a bit on the hard side to pet but it sure looks like it would like to be petted.  With the plant being kept dry over the winters it also has taken a lot of cold.  Some of the plants stay single while others clump.  Mine clumps but is slow at it.</P><P>Regular soil and feeding during growing season and <I>valnicekiaum</I> will reward you with flowers like this quite often.</td><td><img src='gymnocalyciumvalnicekianum.jpg' width=320 height=240></td></tr></TABLE>");

fmart ("What's Bugging You","Jim Daniel","<center>(Continued from last month.)</center></P><P>The next morning I drove back towards the village and stopped to collect some cuttings of <I>Backebergia</I>.  They were about 25 feet tall.  I had a telescoping pruning saw.  I would saw the cuttings almost through, then lasso the end of the stems, break them off, and bring them gently to the ground with the pruning saw.  A couple of men came by.  I asked them if they would like to work awhile.  They agreed.  When I had enough, I paid the fellows off.  Then I noticed one of them was carrying a <I>pistole</I> in a holster on his belt.  This meant that he was either a bandito or lawman.  (Much the same in Mexico.)  They were happy to get the money, and I was glad to get rid of them.</P><P>I drove to the Village and stopped to post a letter to my wife.  I came out of the Post Office, and my truck was surrounded by a platoon of soldiers under the command of a Buck sergeant.  They searched my truck and found my <I>pistole</I>, which the sergeant put in his pocket.  They found nothing else.  I had reloaded my truck and put the full boxes in the nose and the empties on the rear.  The captain came out and decided to search the truck himself.  He stuck his hand into one of the full boxes and promptly pulled it out.  I could see by the expression on his face that he did not like cactus as much as I did.  He said I could go.  I asked him about my <I>pistole</I> in the sergeant's pocket.  He asked what I used it for, and I said for rattlesnakes and coyotes around the camp.  The sergeant released it and I was on my way.</P><P>I needed some <I>Ferocactus lindseyii</I>.  I stopped at a promising hillside and was prowling around, when I noticed a man on a burro with a long machete peering around the under brush.  I stepped out and said hello.  He inquired what I wanted.  I described the cactus I was looking for.  He said there were lots of them on the other side of the hill, and he would show me the way.  I invited him to lead the way as he had his long machete.  I felt comfortable walking behind with my pick.  On the other side of the hill, he showed me his stash of marijuana, about 500 hundred pounds.  I told him I was not interested in it and would not inform the authorities.  I bid him a fond adieu and left for parts richer in cacti.");
