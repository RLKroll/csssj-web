<P>
Bring a plant or plants that got you started in the hobby (obsession?) or that you particularly like now.  It doesn't have to be show quality, just what you love and enjoy.  We want this to be an expanded Show & Tell where we all can share our plants and experiences - successes and failures, cultural hints, etc. This is a great opportunity to expand your knowledge and even discover a new "favorite' plant.

fmart ("What's Bugging You","Jim Daniel","Monstrosity and Cristation in succulent plants bugging you neighbor? A small book was written in the 1930's by a Dutchman named Wolthuys.  He examined every cause that could possibly be the reason for this peculiar growth, then debunked them one by one.</P><P>Insects spread the disease.  Mealy bug spread the disease.  The bruising of the plant by animals or mankind.  Growing problems with the plant.  Under-nourishment and over-Nourishment.</P><P>After the publication of this book a passel of dealers went to the Mojave Desert with base ball bats and tried there hand at creating crests.  The only thing they accomplished was ruining a lot of cactus.  I have witnessed a <I>Ferocactus gracilis</I> growing under a Palo Verde tree.  The wind blown branches rubbed the top of the <I>Ferocactus</I> creating an abnormal top, but not cresting.</P><P>Crests occur rarely in the wild.  Perhaps out of 2000 plants you would only find 2 or 3 monstrose or crested plants.  Crests seem to occur close together I have found six-crested <I>Pachyceres pringlii</I> within a mile of Catavina, Baja CA.  One is the world's biggest crest being ten feet tall and four feet wide.  Most crested plants have a shortened life span due to water getting trapped in the creases or a case of mealy bug hidden from view until it is too late.</P><P>Wolthuys quote: &quot;This is a little book on a subject about which nothing is known, and of which I too am ignorant.&quot;  I say amen to that.</P><P>(<U>The enigma of the origin of monstrosity and cristation in succulent plants</U> by J. J. Verbeek Wolthuys - Ed.)");

fmart ("Why Do We Have a MiniShow?","Paul Long"," The Mini Show has evolved over the years, from a competitive show held at each meeting, and judged by a &quot;Blue Ribbon Panel&quot;, to a less formal, display of plants that fit a certain topic.  The topic might correlate directly to the Program of the month, or the time of the year, or just revolve around and through the species we collect.</P><P>There was a time when members would go to a local Cactus Dealer to purchase the plant of the month, if they didn't have that genus/species, just to be sure to have representation on the Mini show table.</P><P>When Retha and I first joined the Club, the Mini Show was as competitive as the Annual Show, and &quot;Big Bucks&quot; were handed out each winter at the Holiday Party - $15.00 for most points in the year, $10.00 next points, and $5.00 for third. Three winners in each category, Open, Advanced, Intermediate, and Novice.  (Those were the four Show classes we had at the time.)  If you won first in Novice in the Mini Show, you had to move up to Intermediate, quite a price to pay for the glory of winning that $15.00.  Some members would try very hard to not move up, while still bringing plants to the meetings. Difficult.");
