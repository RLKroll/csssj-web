<P>
He's back!

The terror of the slide carousel is returning once again to regale us with another journey into the world of desert plants.  This time he is taking us to Chile, the land of the <I>Copiapoa</I>.

Mark Muradian, whose grandfather started farming in the San Joaquin Valley in 1915, still carries on the family tradition in the same general area.  He has been an avid cultivator of cacti and succulents for nearly 20 years.  Late last year, he presented a travelogue of his trip to Anza-Borrego Desert State Park.

As before, he will have an impressive array of pots for sale.

fmart ("2005 Show and Sale Update","Bill Gingras","The 36th Annual CSSSJ Show and Sale is rapidly approaching.  Our show and sale is being held on April 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> this year, with set up on the 1<sup>st</sup> (no fooling!).</P><P>As you are well aware, the show and sale is very much a volunteer effort.  Please plan on lending a hand this year.  We volunteers always have a blast, and lots of volunteers makes for less work and more fun for everybody.</P><br><P>Signing up to be a volunteer is as easy as 1-2-3:</P><P><OL><li>Judy and I will be circulating a volunteer sign-up list at the March meeting, where you can sign up in person.<br><br></li><li>If you cannot make the meeting, but have access to the World-Wide-Web or email, go to the club's web site (www.csssj.org), click on the &quot;Member's Corner&quot; link that is near the top of the page, then click the &quot;Show &amp; Sale Stuff&quot; link.  In the Enter Network Password screen that appears, type &quot;csssj&quot; for the User Name.  Among the links on that page is a &quot;Volunteering at the Show and Sale&quot; link that will take you to a page that explains the various volunteer positions that we need staffed.  You can send an email to webmaster@csssj.org to sign up, or to ask further questions.<br><br></li><li>Don't have web access or email?  Feel free to give Judy Goodrode or Bill Gingras a call.  We are both listed in the CSSSJ directory.  We'll answer questions, provide the necessary details and add you to the list.</li></OL></P><br><P>Here are some other Show/Sale-related items:</P><P><TABLE cellspacing=8><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>If you volunteer to work at least one shift at the show and sale, you earn a &quot;Show Bucks&quot; coupon worth $5.00 that you can use to buy plants at the show or to use for certain club functions such as raffles.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>A bonus for people who volunteer to help us with set-up or staging, or for people who enter plants in the show, is that you get &quot;first dibs&quot; on sale plants.  Some plants on the sale tables are one-of-a-kind or in very limited quantities, and by being on site on Friday night, you can choose plants before the show opens to the general public (note that this is specifically NOT an invitation to the general club membership to come by and shop early; it is for set-up/staging volunteers and show entrants only).</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>Please consider showing some of your plants.  Briefly, if you have cacti or succulents in your collection that you really like, are presentable (that is, don't have scarring, etiolation, bugs, etc.), and are nicely potted, chances are that the public will really like them too.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>Entering plants in the show is not at all difficult.  If you have web access, follow the instructions above in this article to get to the &quot;Show &amp; Sale Stuff&quot; link.  On that page, you'll find a downloadable version of the 2005 show rules and categories, and a primer that explains how to enter plants in the show.  We will also have the rules and categories and entry cards at the March meeting.  Unfortunately, because the entry cards are color-coded, I am not including them on the web site, but you can pick some up at the March meeting.  They will also be available the night before the show opens while we are setting up.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>If you decide to enter plants in the show, you must bring them in to the show area between 5:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Friday, April 1st (no exceptions!).  You can pick them up after the show closes on Sunday, April 3rd, no sooner than 5:00 p.m. </td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>If you're a club member attending the show and sale, note that we have a potluck/barbecue on both Saturday and Sunday. The club provides the meat (hamburgers, hot-dogs, chicken) and the attendees bring a potluck dish to share.</td></tr></TABLE>");

They are the club's second or third generation that get volunteered to help set-up for our show and sale, the wives or husbands that run around and get the supplies for a club to which they do not even belong, and the friends that just get sucked into it because they were at the right place at the right time.</P><P>This award will be presented annually to the person that the club really could not do without, because this person is very important to not only running the whole thing but also for helping to keep us sane and happy.</P><P>This year we presented our first &quot;Unsung Hero Award&quot; to Lisa Bloss.</P><P>Lisa represents everything that this award stands for:</P><P><UL><li>She has been with the club as a second generation member </li><li>She helps us set-up our show and sale</li><li>She makes boxes with skill and without complaint</li><li>And she is always ready with a smile and a hug</li></UL></P><P>Please join us all in congratulating and thanking Lisa for a job well done!");

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado","When I meet a person that is new to our cactus world I usually ask them what they find interesting about cactus.</P><P>I met some of the members of my new world when they were selling at our county fair many years ago.  I won a plant from them and was instantly hooked. When I first joined the club I was amazed that everyone knew all of the &quot;technical&quot; names.  It was like talking to a bunch of doctors.  &quot;Oh, you'll pick it up in no time&quot; was the phrase I heard over and over again.  Well, I have not, and I probably never will.  I can pretty much tell a cactus from a succulent, but even this is hit and miss.  I still use (to the horror of my fellow members) the common names.  I still do the &quot;oos&quot; and &quot;ahs&quot; when I see a plant for less than $10.00.  And, I will probably never buy a cactus for $100.00.</P><P>I can clearly remember the first cactus that I ever got.  It was a barrel cactus that my friend Steve Inamori gave me, when I was in the hospital my junior year in High School.  He said that flowers just did not seem right for me.  I wonder if he knew what he was starting by that gift?</P><P>I can also tell you that there are as many kinds of plants in this world as there are stars in the sky.  Just when I think that I've got the hang of it, I see something so different that I'm amazed all over again.  It is usually a <I>Euphorbia</I> of some kind.</P><P>I'm amazed at the generosity of the people in this world.  They share their time, knowledge and even their extra plants.  They explain things to me with the patience of Mother Teresa.  And I love the slide shows they give!  I get to join them on their trips to far away places that I probably never will get to see.  I get to hear stories about the chili and spam that they shared after hiking up the side of a mountain to see something the size of a quarter that could only be seen in that one little spot on Earth.  I get to see the total enjoyment that they get by reliving their trips and sharing their knowledge with me.</P><P>Every once in a while when I meet a person that is new to our cactus world, I get to share some very un-technical information with them about this world that I have <I>grown</I> to love.");
