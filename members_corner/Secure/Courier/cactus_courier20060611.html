Most of us have many questions regarding propagating, revitalizing, and maintaining our favorite plants.  Bring a plant and have Naomi discuss how to divide it, make cuttings, and care for the new material.

I have a plant on a graft, and the stems are longer and not as compact a plant as those on their own roots.  I have 2 plants of the DJF 446D, and they do not have any spines on the stems.

On the other plants, there are a few short spines these being to about 1 cm long and brownish in color.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'> The flower buds have quite a few spines up to 2 cm long.

fmart ("A Call to Members","Rich Kroll","I am not writing this as the Courier editor but as a member of this club.  A plant was taken from a reserve box at the Show and Sale.  It happened to be my box, but it could have been anyone's.  The reason this could happen was that there were insufficient volunteers to staff all of the security assignments.  If this were an isolated instance, I would not feel obliged to write this article.  Unfortunately, this is an endemic problem for our club.  When nominations for officers are opened, members have to be cajoled into running or there would not be enough candidates to fill the offices.  It's always the same members who are there for our club, organizing events, arranging presentations, and taking responsibility for seeing that all those little things that make this an exceptional club get done.  Now, we cannot even properly staff a once-a-year event, our Show and Sale.  For me, this is the last straw.  I can be silent no longer.</P><P>I am calling on the inactive members of this club to rethink their noninvolvement.  Our club gives its members so much: informative presentations, entertaining events, the chance to hobnob with some of the giants of our hobby, discounts on plants and pots, great food, fun raffles, and tons more.  So, the next time there is a call for candidates, the next time volunteers are needed, the next time there is something you as a club member could do to keep this club functioning, think about this article and remember that without the active support of its members, no organization can thrive.");

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado","Nicknames were a part of my life, when I grew up.  If you didn't have a nickname, it was probably because you weren't worth the effort, or you had a mother that got really mad, if her kid was called by something other than his given name.  We usually didn't care and just did it anyway.  Most were pretty silly, but some were down right cruel.</P><P>My nickname was Bear.  Not a particularly flattering nickname, but it was one that I could live with.  This name came from a furry jacket that I had as a kid that my friend Steve said made me look like a bear.  (At least that's the story that I tell people.) My friend Kenny was called &quot;Shore Bird&quot;, because, when he ran, he looked just like a little bird on the beach.  He is a minister with six kids now, and we still call him &quot;Shore Bird&quot;.  My father always called his boss &quot;The Old Man.&quot;  A child that was under the age of ten was called &quot;Nina&quot; or &quot;Nino&quot;, because we lived in an area that was predominantly Hispanic.</P><P>When I joined the club many years ago, I only knew the plants by their nicknames (AKA common names).  It was amazing to me that someone could see a slide of a plant that was no bigger than a thumb on the screen and tell what it was.  And I'm not talking about the common names either; they could tell you the <B>real names</B>.</P><P>Now, Bill Kurtz could probably tell you all about the different Sanserveirias in the world, but to me they're all &quot;Mother-in-laws tongues.&quot;  Naomi could tell you about Lithops galore, but I just see &quot;living stones.&quot;  Then there is the &quot;Poinsettia&quot; that should really be called Euphorbia pucherrima, but somehow I don't see that happening anytime soon.</P><P>Shakespeare said &quot;What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&quot;  I agree with Will and say that it isn't so much the name that matters, but the fact that they are all so different and interesting.  If I call it by the nickname, it's only because they are worth the effort, and I know that their moms can't catch me.");

fmart ("Past, Past Prez Sez'","Bill Kurtz","I certainly second Rich's feelings about the need for more member participation in not only the Show & Sale, but also in the monthly meetings.  Most of us have busy schedules, but should be able to find the time to attend some meetings and participate in discussions.  I would like to rejuvenate the Plants of the Month into a member judged Mini-Show with points awarded which will go toward valuable ShowBucks, a special raffle, or other benefits as determined by the Board.</P><P>The following poem was printed in the August 1969 Cactus Courier.  How little things have changed since then.</P><P><font face='Arial'><center><I>Are you an active member - the kind that would be missed?<br>Or are you just contented that your name is on the list?<br>Do you attend the meetings and mingle with the flock?</br>Or do you just stay away and criticize and knock?</P><P>When cacti are being talked about are you alert and quick?<br>Or do you leave the work to just a few and talk about the &quot;clique&quot;?<br>Come often to the meetings, and come with hand and heart.<br>Do not just be a member - take an active part.</P><P>So think this over, friend, and do not take too long -<br>Are you an active member, or do you just belong?</I></center></font></P><P><font size=-1>(Thanks to the &quot;Christchurch Cacto Chat&quot; in New Zealand.
