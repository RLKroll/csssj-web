<P>
Our speaker for this month's meeting is Walter Teague.  He last awed us at our August 2001 meeting with a presentation on his trip to South Africa.  He is back this month with his experiences in landscaping with Cacti and Succulents.
</P>
<P>
Walter has made a number of trips to South Africa as well as our Southwest, the Andes, and Mexico.  He is an expert on Bomeliads, Orchids, and Succulents.   A genus and eight species of Orchids are named for him.

<B class="leadhead">2003 CSSSJ Show and Sale - Sales View</B><br>
<font size=-1><B>by Bill Munkacsy</B></font>
<P>
We have just completed a very successful show thanks to the efforts of many.  Our sales were great.  The trend of lower sales each year was sharply reversed due to a number of factors.  People liked the April show with many plants in bloom.  Bill Kurtz getting a full-page article in the local newspaper brought out many new enthusiasts.  We had a number of first time showers in the show and our tables were full.  How about Richard Demming lifting those heavy plants?!  The show knocked the socks off the public and induced buying interest.  Advertising was very successful this year, and we got a lot of names for next year.
</P>
<P>
The vendors all had a great show.  They worked well together witnessed by the fact that the show was cleaned up in only an hour, which has to be a new record.  The plants for sale were excellent.  Things went very smoothly.  Special thanks to Joan Kurtz and Karla Munkacsy who spent the entire show behind the cash registers.  Elton Roberts ran a great raffle.  Jim Boehmke had his table next to the registers, answered numerous questions, and carried plants purchased out to people's cars.  These people did their jobs above and beyond the call of duty.

Those of us in charge of planning the event were a bit nervous about moving it from the Mother's Day weekend.  Wow, were we pleasantly surprised at the outcome!  Judy and I agree that this year's was the best show we have had the pleasure of being in charge of.  Over 310 plants were entered, and we had six first time exhibitors.  The sale was equally as impressive, with eleven vendors selling all kinds of neat stuff.</P><P>We owe a great deal of gratitude to all of the volunteers who signed up and stepped in to help keep everything running smoothly.  We also want to say a big &quot;thank you&quot; to all of the exhibitors, especially the six brave souls who entered plants into the show for the first time this year.
