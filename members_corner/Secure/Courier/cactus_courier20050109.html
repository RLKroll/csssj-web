<P>
Richard Bernard, David Dupre, and Walter Teague traveled through southeastern California (including Death Valley as well as Anza-Borrego) exploring the spring flora of California.  Richard Bernard will be presenting a slideshow of the cacti and succulent plants they found there.  Although this was an extended trip of 10 to 12 days, many of these areas could be enjoyed on a long weekend.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bernard was a very active member in our club before joining the San Francisco club.  He is very knowledgeable about cacti and succulents and is an extremely successful grower.

I have had <I>Austrocactus garcilis</I> for 8 years and this is the first time it has bloomed.  The plant comes from the area of Argentina known as Patagonia.  In habitat, the plants grow to about 35 cm long; I do not know how long in cultivation.  My plant is now 15 cm tall (6&quot;).  The spines are 3 cm long (1.25&quot;) with a small but good hook at the tip of the central.  The hooked part is of a different color than the rest of the spine.  This makes it hard to see in the photo but they are there.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><br><br>I have not treated this plant any differently than the other plants in my collection.
