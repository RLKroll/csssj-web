<B class="leadhead">Jim Daniel - Trips to Baja California</B><br>
<br>
<P>
As most of you know, Jim Daniel is a mainstay and boundless knowledge source for our club.  For many years, he was the proprietor, grower, and entrepreneur of the famed Cactus Gem Nursery.  Jim has traveled the world lecturing on succulent plants and always increasing his already staggering knowledge of their character, cultivation, care, and nomenclature.
</P>
<P>
Jim's &quot;What's Bugging You?&quot; articles have often graced the pages of the Cactus Courier.  At the meetings, we all turn to Jim for the final say on how to fix a plant problem or to identify a puzzling plant.
</P>
<P>
This month, Jim will be regaling us with tales and photos of his explorations in Baja California.

It is suppose to be hard to grow.  I have plants that are many years old, and I have not had any problem with them so far.  The main idea is to have a fast draining soil and to not water too often.  We have a habit of saying to not water too much, but it is said &quot;do not water too often&quot; for when you water, you want to make sure that they get watered thoroughly.  Then allow the soil to dry completely before watering again.  Feeding during the growing season also helps a lot.</td><td><TABLE><tr><td><img src='mammillariainsularissinglehead.jpg' width=320 height=240 hspace=0></td></tr><tr><td align=center><font size=-2 color='#6699CC'><I>Mammillaria insularis</I></font></td></tr></TABLE></td></tr></TABLE></center>");

fmart ("Drifting Through the Mojave Desert","Jim Daniel","In mid-April of this year (2004), Paul Long and I took a little drive.  I picked up Paul at his The Cactus Flat Nursery in Dos Palos.  We picked up Route 99 and traveled to Bakersfield.  We went east on Route 58.  Just before we hit the Tehachapi Mountains, we crossed the Caliente River.  This is the location of <I>Opuntia basilaris var. treleasei.</I>  As we went up the mountains, we spotted <I>Yucca whipplei</I> growing on the walls of the road cut.  As we rolled down into the Mojave Desert, we came into <I>Yucca brevifolia</I> with its arms raised to the sky.  As the Mormons said, &quot;Like Joshua supplicating the Lord.&quot;</P><P>We drove through Barstow and Daggett, into the Ord Mountains.  We saw loads of <I>Ferocactus acanthodes</I> and <I>Echinocactus polycephalus</I>, also <I>Opuntia erinacea v. ursina</I>, <I>Opuntia acanthocarpa</I>, <I>Opuntia bigelovii</I>, and <I>Yucca schidigera</I> (old name, <I>mojavensis</I>).</P><P>Just east of Baker, we came to Cima Dome, which is now a park.  Here we found a forest of <I>Yucca brevifolia v. jaegeriana</I> (smaller size to eight feet tall and branching at two feet tall), <I>Yucca schidigera</I>, and <I>Yucca baccata</I> (&quot;Spanish Bayonet&quot;).  We also found <I>Echinocereus mohavensis</I>, <I>Opuntia ramosissima</I>, and <I>Opuntia basilaris</I>.</P><P>Next stop was north of Las Vegas, NV in the Charleston Mountains.  We drove up into the mountains until we got to the ski lodge.  The ground was covered with snow, and the Douglas Firs were magnificent.  Paul took photos with his new digital camera.  We took a loop road through the Juniper forest looking for <I>Agave utahensis v. eborispina</I>.  No luck!  We did find a beautiful form of <I>Echinocereus mohavensis</I>.  The cobs were large, and the spines were golden.  We also found many clusters of a very robust form of <I>Echinocereus engelmannii</I>.  We took a drive through the Sheep Mountains.  We did not see any mountain sheep, but we did see the aforementioned cacti and succulents in great profusion.</P><P>We drove back to Las Vegas, and on to Searchlight.  There we found <I>Mammillaria tetrancistra</I>, <I>Coryphantha desertii</I>, and <I>Echinocactus johnsonii</I> (also known as <I>Neolloydia</I>, <I>Echinomastus</I>, and <I>Ferocactus</I>).  We next drove to Sandy Valley, NV to look at the <I>Agave utahensis v. nevadensis</I>.  These we found in great abundance.  Then it was a long drive home, but it was a great trip.");
