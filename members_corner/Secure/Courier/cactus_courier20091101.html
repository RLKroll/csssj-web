<br>
<P>
If you have been to our Country Store before, you know that this is one of the most fun events of the season.  It is a great opportunity for you to share with your fellow members. (Bring plants that you think other members would enjoy, unless you are looking forward to taking them back home yourself.  If you bring desserts, make certain that they are individually wrapped.)
</P>
<P>
Here is how it works.  First separate tables are set up for each category, cacti, succulents, associated items, and desserts.  Then we all buy tickets at five tickets for a dollar.  Members can use their tickets in whatever categories they like.  A board member for each table picks tickets, and each winning member in the order their ticket was selected gets their pick of what is on that table.  This is repeated until the Country Store is done or everyone dies laughing.
</P>
<P>
No MiniShow is planned for this meeting because of the Country Store.  Of course, if you have something of particular interest, you are welcome to bring it.

The fall show is different from the one in spring.  In the spring, the show plants are judged by professional judges.  But in our fall event, the show plants are judged by the public.  Similar to how we judge the mini shows at our monthly meetings, each show visitor was given dots for voting, and those dots were distributed among the plants thought to be the nicest or most special.  The plants with the most dots won.</P><P>There were a lot of very interesting plants on display. I myself found it hard to choose among the many excellent plants.  A few that struck my eye were a huge <I>Opuntia santarita</I> from Oliver Silva, a large flowering <I>Pachypodium brevicaule</I> from Naomi Bloss, and a perfectly flowering <I>Orbea variegata</I> from Tony Bassano.  I would also like to mention a large collection of variegated plants exhibited by Ellen and Gary Stubblefield.</P><P>Six prizes were given - three for the top vote getters among the cacti and three for the other succulents.  A large and beautifully shaped <I>Deuterocohnia brevifolia</I> from Bill Gingras got the most dots (107) among the succulents and the most points overall and thus won first prize.  Second place was awarded to a huge <I>Opercularia decaryi</I> (86 dots) entered by Naomi Bloss.  A great looking rose-crested variegated <I>Euphorbia lactea</I> from Bill Munkacsy won third place with 73 dots.</P><P>The first prize for cacti went to Bill Munkacsy for his gorgeous <I>Epithelantha chihuahuensis</I>, which garnered 85 dots.  Second place went to Elton Roberts.  His Shrek-like <I>Puna clavaroides</I> received 36 dots.  A nicely blooming <I>Astrophytum asteria</I> (33 dots) was third.  It was entered by Bill Munkacsy.</P><P>The fall show event was also the time to judge the Irish redhead cacti we grew as members over the summer.  The race was very close among several plants.  When the votes were tallied, Sonia Dyer won first prize with her entry, which she planted in a faux dead cow skull.</P></td></tr></TABLE></P><P><center><font size='-1'>(Photographs provided by Kathi Cambiano)</font></center></P>");

At which time, they will not stand up right, but will become lax with the stem ends up right.  The wool in the axils becomes quite dense, when the plant reaches blooming size.  The plants in the photos have just started to bloom this year.  It is at this time that they also put out the central spines.  The spines are 1-3 cm long.  The flowers can be to 5-7 cm for me; 5 cm is about the rule.  These photos were taken on September 25, so you can see that the plants are still blooming.  I have several in bloom.
