In March there were four entries that didn’t have names on them.  I was hoping that the folks would show up at the May meeting, but unfortunately they did not.  Therefore, I am including a copy of the entries with this newsletter in the hope that I can finally get the March results attributed to the appropriate people.

fmart ("Grower's Garden","Elton Roberts","<TABLE width='100%'><tr><td valign='top'><img src='ariocarpus scaphirostris pl.jpg' width=320 height=280 hspace=17 align='left'><br><I>Ariocarpus scaphirostris</I> comes from Mexico in the state of Nuevo Leon.  In habitat, usually only the tips of the tubercles are above soil level.  There are no spines on the tubercles.  Seedlings will at times have some weak spines.  These soon fall off. The plants are to about 8 cm in diameter.  I would have to guess that with all the collecting, that in habitat, they probably are not that large any more.  The plants are slow growing, and it can take years to reach 3 cm across.  They are quite easy to grow from seed, but it takes some time to get a plant 1 cm across.  In cultivation, the plants get a bit larger.  I had one that was 14 cm across.  (It is disgusting that rats like <I>Ariocarpus</I> so much more than other cacti right next to them.)  My largest one now is 8 cm across.</td></tr><tr><td><img src='ariocarpus scaphirostris.jpg' width=320 height=280 hspace=17 align='right'><br>Flowers are magenta and to 5 cm across.  The plant blooms from end of summer (around September) until early winter (December and sometimes in January).  The seed pods show through the wool the next summer.  The plant is kind of rare in collections.  I guess this is because it rots quite easy.  It needs a fast draining soil.  The soil needs to dry between waterings. Do not be in a rush to water the plant in the spring time and watch the watering come fall.</P><P>If you noticed the spelling of the name, you will see that it is different from what we usually see.  The spelling above is supposed to be the correct spelling, and <I>scapharostrus</I> is, according to Hunt, incorrect.  Despite the spelling, it is a wonderful plant!!!</td></tr></TABLE>");

fmart ("CSSA Convention Report, April 2011","Cecelia Pelicon","And in the beginning, a dilemma.  Can an elderly lady go alone to a convention?  How can an aged brain cope alone with the bewildering maze of the S.F. airport?  Is going alone where most people are in &quot;twosies&quot;, pathetic?  Who will take care of my dog?  Worry, fuss, fret!  Is it better to stay home and be invisible?  Nah.</P><P>My beloved dog went to Pet Smart Hotel in San Carlos.  He had a suite with a TV, walks, play times, and hung out with Zoey, a Papillon.  My guilt trip resolved.</P><P>Plane reservations were made on computer and also included a wheelchair with pusher.  I was zipped through security and zapped to departure.  Airport not a problem.</P><P>There were 300 plus &quot;succulent&quot; persons at the convention from all over the world.  I met all kinds of interesting ones.  I was never bored or lonely.  I enjoyed seeing the Harrises and the Stubblefields from the San Jose club.</P><P>Speakers gave lectures for every level of collector from the technically advanced to the just beginning neophytes.  My favorite talk was on plant mutants, crests, monstrose, and variegates.</P><P>There were different all-day field trips that all went out the same day - to the desert, to botanical gardens, private homes, etc.  We had to choose just one.  I chose a three-stop nursery tour.  Most educational was Western Cacti with 20 acres of mature, in-ground plants and tons of greenhouses with thousands of seedlings growing their little hearts out.  And we were allowed to buy!  Wholesale!</P><P>Venders at the hotel had rare plants for sale.  The San Diego club had large, gorgeous plants for show.  Mark Muradian, potter, had his totally unique pots for sale.  And there was a plant auction for the wealthy.</P><P>I attended the affiliates meeting.  Concerns were mostly about convention costs.  The next one, less expensive, will be in Texas in 2013.");
