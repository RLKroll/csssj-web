<P>
The January program will be a hands-on affair with members working with an all-star group of experts to learn how to present their favorite plants in the best way for showing.  Naomi Bloss and Rowena Southwell will demonstrate their winning techniques with their own and your plants and pottery.
</P>
<P>
We strongly encourage attendees to bring their own plants - Please! - And work with our presenters to gain insight into the methods used to stage plants for the show.  Now that we are not having our annual show and sale on Mothers' Day weekend, we hope that previous non-participants will participate.
</P>
<P>
A potting medium (no charge) will be available.  Top dressing, surplus plants from our Holiday party, and some pots will be available for sale, as will some of our club's surplus plants and beautiful pottery.  Participants also should try to bring some rocks, weathered wood, etc. to include in the presentation.  Although the staging represents a small percentage (5% - 10%) of the total points in judging, that's enough to produce a winner in a close race.
</P>
<P>
Even if you don't plan to show your plants in competition, it's nice to give them a treat and present them to yourself and friends in the best possible way (possibly for the mini-show). 
</P>
<P>
The Bloss's California Succulents will be providing some of their marvelous plants for sale, too.

fmart ("What's Bugging You","Jim Daniel","My first experience in that field was late in the 1950's. I had been reading about all those lovely Cactus growing around Barstow, CA.  I loaded up my wife and four children in my almost new 1949 Chevrolet Station Wagon.  Took along a war surplus trenching tool, wore my good slacks & a short sleeved sport shirt.  A pair of leather soled Wing Tipped shoes and no hat.  We arrived in Barstow, I set out to make my first collection, I soon learned that leather soled shoes were a poor choice.  For every step I made on a steep incline, I slide back two.  Going barefoot was not an option, the soil was almost pure gravel and being attacked by a rattlesnake or an irate Cactus was a distinct possibility.  I soon found an <I>Echinocactus polycephalus</I>; I attacked with my trenching tool and found it to be entirely inadequate for the job.  After shedding much sweat and not a little blood, I was forced to admit defeat.  I did find an <I>Echinocereus engelmannii</I>, <I>Mammillaria tetracntra</I> & an <I>Opuntia erinacea v ursina</I> and a painful sunburn.</P><P>If you go in search of the wild cactus be sure and wear a sturdy pair of boots, a long sleeved shirt, a pair of jeans and a straw hat.  Your digging tools can consist of a rock hammer and a light pick.  Oh yes, leave the wife and kids at home.</P><P>(Note: Check with the local authorities before field collecting.  In some areas, field collecting is prohibited. - Ed.)");

fmart ("Prez Sez - New","Wes Briggs","Just a quick note from your new President.  We have been getting some new members the last six months.  Let's keep bringing in the new blood.  We should try to keep the new members interested and involved.  I will be there on January 5th to see what I can do to carry on the good works of the Past President, Bill Kurtz.  Anyone with any suggestions, please see me.</P><P>Thank you.");

fmart ("Prez Sez - Past","Bill Kurtz","Reflecting on the past four years of my tenure as your President, I see our organization very much like the plants we love.  There is the frustration of deaths and infirmities we can not control but only overcome.  There is the new growth and the flowers that are the reward for our care and effort.  Our club grows and prospers from the care and attention we give it.  (Thanks for the idea Joan.)</P><P>I want to thank those who have unstintingly helped to make our annual sale and show a success.  If only a few people worked on the setup and teardown, it would be an insurmountable job.  It is only with the unselfish participation of the club's members that we have had successful shows.</P><P>After considerable discussion, the board has decided to move the annual show and sale away from Mothers' Day to April 5th and 6th.  We hope that this will help improve the participation in the show.  Only time will tell.</P><P>I particularly want to recognize the efforts of Rich Kroll as the editor of this newsletter.  He has taken over this task when we sorely needed someone to step up.  (See below.)");

fmarted ("Editor's Corner","Rich Kroll","Rather than have your editor fill this space, wouldn't it be better to fill it with contributed articles from our members.  Please send me articles on your plants, plant care, or techniques associated with our hobby.  Submissions may be made either by email or by regular mail.
