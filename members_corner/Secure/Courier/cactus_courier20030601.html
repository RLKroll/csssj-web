<P>
Bill, his wife, and a friend recently traveled to Central Mexico to see the local cacti and succulents in their native habitat under spring-time conditions.  Bill will discuss their trip, the state of field collection by foreign nationals, and show slides of the plants they saw in Mexico.
</P>

Bill may bring to the meeting some of his exceptional plants for sale.

<B class="leadhead">Tour of Growers for July</B><br>
<P>
Back by popular demand, we will be having a tour of local growers for our July meeting.  This tour will focus on three or four growers in the Monterey Bay area.  Many are known by their vendor activities at our and other cacti and succulent sales, but their growing yards have not been visited by most of our members.  (This will not be a poker run and will not finish at a barbecue.)

fmart ("What's Bugging You","Jim Daniel","The subject today is highly depressing.  I will bore you this once and never bring the subject up again.  There are a few thieves amongst us.  It is a very rewarding hobby, and plant collectors are all very honest with a few exceptions.  Years ago, we had a member of the San Jose society who had the nickname of &quot;The Slasher&quot;.  He earned the name, because he used a knife to take cuttings of other peoples plants with out permission. </P><P>My next door neighbor spotted a customer placing a <I>Mamillaria</I> between her breasts and walking out with it.  It was only a 2 3/4 inch pot, but a hooked spined <I>Mamillaria</I> must have been painful.  If she had asked, I gladly would have given the plant to her. Another plant, an <I>Agave Huchucensus</I>, a full three feet in diameter potted in an Oriental pot, turned up missing the night after it was potted.  It must have taken four strong men to haul it away in a truck.</P><P>There were a couple of Landscapers in the San Diego area who would take potential customers on a tour of places with big specimen plants in the ground.  If their customers liked the plant, they were told that they could furnish a plant that looked just like it.  If the customer agreed, they would show up at Midnight Nursery Supply and steal the plant from the owners. </P><P>Just a word of caution, don't plant pretty specimens in the front yard close to the street.  Beware of people who work as a team.  One keeps you occupied, while the other one fills Baggies with your plants.  To the person who &quot;temporarily borrowed&quot; Sam Keeton's five headed <I>Strombocactus discifomis</I> from one of the local shows, Sam would like it back now.");

fmart ("Additions to Our Library","Bill Kurtz","Bill Munkacsy has generously donated a book on cycads to our library.  This is a complete overview of the amazing world of cycads from Mexico to Africa to India and beyond.  These relics of the age of the dinosaurs are fascinating plants and many, as you can see from the article below, are coveted by collectors and command premium prices (in both the open an black markets.)  The format and illustrations are superb.</P><P>We also have an addition of Gordon Rowley's book on <I>Crassulas</I>.  Here again, the quality of photographs and descriptions are of the highest level.</P><P>If you are interested in either of these volumes, contact our librarian, Lori Habib, at 408-292-2340.");

fmart ("Quail Botanical Gardens Recovers Rare Cycads after Saturday Night Theft","","Personnel at Quail Botanical Gardens, located in Encinitas, in San Diego County, California, were on an emotional roller coaster ride earlier this year, when 21 <I>Encephalartos</I> (very rare African cycads) were stolen from the plantings near the Larabee House at QBG.  All were mature plants, with four of them having been received from the U.S. FWS as confiscated specimens placed at the Gardens as part of their involvement with plant rescue.</P><P>An alert was faxed to industrypersons and those in law enforcement throughout the Southland, Monday following the disappearance of the cycads Saturday night.  The alert stated many of the plants are unique specimens and would be easy to identify even though they have been defoliated.  Julian Duval, executive director of Quail Botanical Gardens, urged people to keep their eyes and ears open, and report any information to him or law enforcement agencies. </P><P>Two weeks later, an anonymous caller left a message on QBG's voice mail, saying they knew where the stolen cycads could be found.  The caller (male) then proceeded to give detailed directions to two locations in the adjacent area.  One location was on Twin Oaks Valley Road, north of Twin Oaks Crest, and the other location was a quarter mile west of the I-15 on the road to San Luis Downs. </P><P>On Monday, QBG staff met with four San Diego County Sheriff's Department officers at the two sites.  Fifteen plants were recovered at the first site, in a ditch along the road.  The other six plants were recovered at the second location, among debris, which included a dead dog.</P><P>While the plants suffered from this experience, staff are encouraged that all will survive with time and care.  Director Duval commented: &quot;While increased security measures were implemented from the time of the theft, we are still evaluating what long term measures will be most effective in deterring any future thefts.  Conversations I have had since the theft with other public garden directors and collection managers who are responsible for the care and display of rare cycads does point to a common vulnerability.  I was surprised as to how many institutions have lost plants to theft and the problem is getting worse.&quot;</P><P>In his &quot;Good News!&quot; announcement, which was faxed to the same people that received the Alert, Duval thanked the many people who responded with well wishes and the potential leads.  He also thanked the media for giving this theft the high profile it did.  Without the media attention, he doubted the plants would have been recovered.  Mr. Duval also thanked the community of private cycad enthusiasts and conservationists, who helped get the word out about the theft.  The recovery of the cycads made front-page news and was prominently featured on TV news programs.</P><P>Mr. Duval thanked the Sheriff's Department for their dedicated investigations, and felt the perpetrators would be located in the future.  &quot;I'm sure it is appreciated as to how this theft impacted the staff and volunteers who have worked so hard to establish these plants in a conservation role.  While no one ever verbalized it, there was little hope that we would ever see these plants again.  Feelings are very high at this time, but in no way is a distraction to our resolve to protect what we have,&quot; he added.</P><P>(Reprinted from &quot;Pacific Coast Nurseryman and Garden Supply Dealer Magazine&quot; April 2003)");
