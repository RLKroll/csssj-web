fmart ("2003 SHOW & SALE UPDATE","Bill Gingras"," Planning for the 2003 CSSSJ Show and Sale continues to move along.  We have been busy behind the scenes to make this year's show and sale a success.<P>Certainly by now, you've heard that the 2003 CSSSJ Show and Sale is being held in early April, NOT Mother's Day weekend, haven't you?  It seems as though some competitors, volunteers, and buyers alike have had a hard time convincing Mom that the best way to spend her special day is by admiring the subtle differences between different variants of <I>Euphorbia milli</I>.  Anyway, our show and sale is being held on April 5th and 6th this year, with set up on the 4th.</P><P>We're looking for volunteers.  The show and sale is very much a volunteer effort.  Judy and I will be circulating the volunteer sign-up list at the February and March meetings.  If you cannot make the meetings, but would still like to help out, please give Judy Goodrode (408-265-0722) or me (Bill Gingras) (408-227-5424) a call.  We'll give you the necessary details and add you to the list.  Either way, please consider helping out.  We volunteers always have a blast, and lots of volunteers makes for less work and more fun for everybody.</P><P>Here are some other Show/Sale-related items:<UL type='circle'><li>If you work at least one shift at the show and sale, you earn a &quot;Show Bucks&quot; coupon worth $5.00 that you can use to buy plants with at the show, or to use for certain club functions such as raffles.<br><br></li><li>A bonus for people who volunteer to help us set up, or for people who enter plants in the show, is that you get &quot;first dibs&quot; on sale plants.  Some plants on the sale tables are one-of-a-kind or in very limited quantities, and by being on site on Friday night, you can choose plants before the show opens to the general public.  (Note that this is specifically NOT an invitation to the general club membership to come by and shop early; this is for set-up volunteers and show entrants only).<br><br></li><li>Now that the &quot;Mother's Day monkey&quot; is finally off your back, please consider showing some of your plants.  Briefly, if you have cacti or succulents in your collection that you really like, are presentable (that is, don't have scarring, etiolation, bugs, etc.), and are in nice pots, enter them in the show so that the public can enjoy them too.  If you have some favorite plants at home, but are not sure of how &quot;showable&quot; they are, bring them to either the February or March meeting.  Several experienced members will be at those meetings who would just love to mentor you on your plant's potential.<br><br></li><li>Entering is not very hard.  We will have the rules, category lists, and entry forms at the next two meetings.  If you are confused about what to do, just ask around.  Many of us have shown before and would love to lend a hand to newcomers.  Showing is fun, and you can learn a lot about your plants from the judges if you show.<br><br></li><li>We will be awarding some very nice pottery to the winners this year.<br><br></li><li>We will be holding a special raffle for club members who are competing (showing one or more plants) in our show for the first time.  More details will appear in next month's Courier.<br><br></li><li>If you decide to enter plants in the show, you must bring them in to the show area between 5:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Friday, April 4th (no exceptions!).  You can pick them up after the show closes on Sunday, April 6th, after 5:00 p.m.<br><br></li><li>If you're a club member attending the show and sale, note that we put on a potluck/barbecue on both Saturday and Sunday.  The club provides the meat (hamburgers, hot-dogs, chicken) and the attendees bring a potluck dish to share.</UL>");


fmart ("Past-Prez Sez","Bill Kurtz","Lori Habib, a new board member, has taken over the duties of club Librarian.  As you know, Manson Waters has performed these duties admirably for many years.  We look forward to Lori providing us with information about books from our library that will capture our interest.</P><P>Sandy Carter, although no longer a board member, has continued her contributions to our club by being our Membership Chair.  Once Sandy and I have completed making corrections to our membership list, Sam Keeton again will be publishing our 2003 roster.  Thank you Sam.  That reminds me that we have several members who have yet to bring their membership up to date.  Please, please, use the membership form at the end of the Courier to make your membership current. </P><P>P.S. If for any reason you are unable to contact Judy Goodrode or Bill Gingras about participation in our annual show, you can contact me at 408-243-3692.");

fmarted ("Club Caricature","Rich Kroll","As many of you know, I am working on drawing a caricature of our club.  Several members have already participated, and I am hard at work immortalizing them.  If you are interested in being included, I will be bringing my camera and a short questionnaire to the meeting.  The questionnaire is just to give me some ideas about how best to represent you.  Answer whichever questions you like.");
