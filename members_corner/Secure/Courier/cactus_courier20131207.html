Everyone who brings a plant puts it on the center table for the plant exchange.  A club officer will select the best plant which will be added to the auction plants.  The person who brought that plant is the first to select from the exchange.  Whoever brought the plant the first person picked picks next, and so forth until all the plants have been taken.  When all the plants are gone, the last person selects a plant from the gift plants.
</P>
<P>
There will be two categories of plants for the auction: plants under $20 and plants over $20.  For the plants under $20 the first person bidding $20 will get the plant.  The auction in this area will be silent; there will be a card next to the plant in which people will bid on the plant.  When time is up, only the top three bidders will be able to bid on the plant. Again the first person to bid $20 will get the plant.  The plants over $20 will be handled the same way; only on both categories there will be a minimum bid that will be listed and bidding will start from the minimum bid.  Members can bring in their own plants for the auction.  If you are interested, contact Bill Munkacsy at 925-935-5213. (See article on the next page for details.)
</P>
<P>
Members who renew at or before the December meeting will participate in a special plant raffle.

fmart ("Christmas Auction","Bill Munkacsy","Hi Everyone.</P><P>We will be having our Christmas Extravaganza party Saturday December 7.  Part of the celebration is our Christmas auction consisting of plant and plant related materials.  During the Christmas party we do NOT have a feature where you can just buy plants for a fixed price; we leave that to our two shows.  But what we do have is two ways for you to pick up quality plants at prices YOU want to pay:<OL><li>We have a portion of the auction set aside for plants $20 and under.  Any one member can bring 10 plants to put in this category.  In this area of the auction you can bid up to $20 for a plant.  The first person bidding $20 gets the plant.  Hint: if you are looking for something special get here early and bid $20 and get the prize before someone else does.<br><br>We recommend setting a minimum bid on plants.  Consigners need to put on the card the bare minimum they will take for the plant.  We start the bidding there.  We will NOT waive the minimum or change it once it is established. The item will not sell if the minimum is not obtained; it will be put aside until after the auction and then sold if a buyer is willing to pay the minimum.  There will be no direct sales by consigners to buyers at any time during or after the party in the facility.  Consigners donate a 30% fee to the club for each item sold, and sales tax will be charged buyers in accordance with California law.  Karla and Judy are lined up to keep records of the sales and do the bookwork<br><br></li><li>The other portion of the auction is a standard auction with no maximum price.  Any one member can bring 10 plants to put in this part of the auction.  Plants will be sold to the highest bidder.  Again a minimum bid is recommended to be placed on each item in this category by the consigner, and the auction will be carried out starting with this price. Again rules of the auction will be followed as outlined above.  Plants that sell for $100 or more will be charged a 20% donation fee to the club for each item sold.</OL><P>We all would appreciate your help and tolerance during the auction.  We go through a large amount of plants in a short while, and we want to give everyone a fair and equal chance at selling their plants.");

I have on the plants the names as they were some years ago.  <I>Mammillaria glassii</I> is a small flowered plant.  When the plant with the big white flowers came out, it was called <I>M. ascensionis</I>.  When Dr. Lau found the large pink flowered plant, it was called <I>M. nominis-dulcis</I>.  Now I see that both of these plants and <I>Mammillaria siberiensis</I> are lumped under <I>M. glassii ssp. ascensionis</I>.  The plants come from the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon at a high elevation.  That being to 2,750 meters high. (That is over 9,000 feet elevation for those who do not do the metric system all that well.)  Now coming from an elevation that high, the plants do not do all that good in hot low elevation areas.  So they go dormant, when night time temperatures stay above about 14.4 C or 58 degrees F.  Even though the plants are more forgiving than some plants, it is still wise to go light on the watering in the heat of summer.<br><center><img src='mammillaria glassii v ascensionis.jpg' width=400 height=340 hspace=17 vspace=23></center></td></tr></TABLE></center>");

fmart ("Books for Sale","Rich Kroll","Millie Zink was a member of the CSSSJ for many years, until she moved to Northern California a while ago.  She married, and her name is now Millie Seiber.  She wrote to me recently.  She is interested in selling her collection of cacti and succulent books.</P><P>Here is how she would like to do this.  If there is any interest, you can email her, and if no one has made a higher bid for the book, she will send it to you. The USPS has padded envelopes which would be useful if the book or books aren't too thick. Otherwise she will use the boxes the USPS has for $5.00 and up, depending on how big a box is needed.  She will email the buyer to let them know how much shipping will be added to the cost of the book.</P><P>The books are all in excellent condition, as the buyer will be able to see before they pay.  (You can find the market prices at <a href='http://www.abebooks.com/' target='_blank'>ABEbooks.com</a>.)  She feels that she can trust the members of the group to follow through on the purchase once they have received the books.</P><P>The list is available online at <a href='http://www.csssj.org/members_corner/Secure/zink003.html' target='_blank'>http://www.csssj.org/members_corner/Secure/zink003.html</a>.
