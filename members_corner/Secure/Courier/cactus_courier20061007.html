The all-knowing Nigel Taylor in his book on <I>Echinocereus</I> that was published in 1985 goes along with Backeberg.  That is sure good studying of the plants on his part.  It is now set straight in the German <I>Echinocereus</I> book, &quot;<I>Echinocereus</I>&quot; by Blum, Lange, Rischer,and Rutow.  I always figured that something was wrong, because the plants looked so different from <I>W. poselgeri,</I> so I never changed the name.

fmart ("Prez Sez'","Bill Munkacsy","From the hot summer to the cool fall, this is the time of the best growth for our plants.  After the hot spell killed off some of our plants, it will be a good time to replace those with new plants from our show and sale next week.  It's a fall closeout for many, so you should find bargains and one of a kind plants.  I have gone about and gathered such for this show and expect others to do the same.   This show WILL BE DIFFERENT in that half will be NEW vendors to our club's S&amp;S!  You need to be there and check it out.  I won't single out names, but it will be a pleasant surprise to see the sellers who are there.  Don't forget cash or check, no credit cards.  We always need volunteers, so please come each day.  You will be fed Friday night and Saturday lunch.  Please bring potluck especially to the Saturday picnic; again this is free and open to all members.  Please bring boxes so that we can pack plants for our customers' sale plants.  Please if you have extra cuttings or a plant that needs a new home bring it.  We will have a donation table where it will be priced and sold by the club for the club.  And again, please bring plants to show.  This will be fun, no hassle, no judges, just our guests voting for their favorite plants and display.  Next weekend will be fun.  Enjoy the weekend.  See you there at the fall S&amp;S!");

He left about 1/3 of his nursery stock of plants behind.  Some are small (in about 4&quot; pots) and some up to commercial landscaping size.  We know only a handful of the plant names.
