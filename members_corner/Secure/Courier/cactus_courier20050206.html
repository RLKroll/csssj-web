<br>
<P>
The February program will be a hands-on affair with members working with an all-star group of experts to learn how to present their favorite plants in the best way for showing.  Naomi Bloss and Rowena Southwell will demonstrate their winning techniques with their own and your plants and pottery.
</P>
<P>
We strongly encourage attendees to bring their own plants - Please! - And work with our presenters to gain insight into the methods used to stage plants for the show.
</P>
<P>
A potting medium (no charge) will be available.  Top dressing, surplus plants from our Holiday party, will be available for sale, as will some of our club's surplus plants.  Participants also should try to bring some rocks, weathered wood, etc. to include in the presentation.  Although the staging represents a small percentage (5% - 10%) of the total points in judging, that's enough to produce a winner in a close race.
</P>
<P>
Even if you don't plan to show your plants in competition, it's nice to give them a treat and present them to yourself and friends in the best possible way.  (Think mini-show.)
</P>
<P>
The Bloss's California Succulents will be providing some of their marvelous plants for sale, too.

I have contacted several nurseries that claimed that they had the white flower plant.  The only answer I would get is &quot;We cannot guarantee what color the flower will be.&quot;  Some of the places that advertised it would not answer; I guess that they did not have the white flower plant either.  The BCSS was advertising seed for <I>E. pentalophus</I> with the white flower.  A friend in England got seed and got some plants up.  She gave me five seedlings to see what would come of the flower color.  All turned out to be pink like any other <I>E. pentalophus</I> except several of the flowers were a lighter shade of pink.  I crossed those and got seed.  In time, I planted the seed and had a very good germination.  I potted up some 230 plants and have been watching them grow and waiting for the time for them to bloom.  I figured that I might get one to maybe five plants with white flowers if I was lucky.  There are still 13 plants out of the 230 that have buds and these are big enough to bloom in the next about 5 to 15 days.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><br>This year while the same friend was here, we saw that several of the plants were throwing flower buds.  By the end of her visit the buds were quite large.  As Mother Nature does at times, she then threw us a cool spell and the buds stopped growing. So my friend did not get to see the plants bloom in person.  She will get several clones of <I>E. pent. 'albiflora'</I> for she has been as interested as I was in finding the elusive plant.</P><P>It is interesting that the first two plants to open flowers from that seed planting were white flowering.  I know that some will throw pink flowers and even seed of the white flowering plants will still throw pink flowering plants.  At least I can take cuttings and get this plant moving.  I think it is glorious!!! </td><td><TABLE><tr><td><img src='echinocereuspentalophusw-fl.jpg' width=320 height=240 hspace=0></td></tr><tr><td align='center'><font size=-2 color='#6699CC'><I>Echinocereus pentalophus 'albiflora'</I></font></td></tr></TABLE></td></tr><tr><td><TABLE><tr><td><img src='e pentalophuswhitex2.jpg' width=320 height=240 hspace=0></td></tr><tr><td align='center'><font size=-2 color='#6699CC'><I>Echinocereus pentalophus 'albiflora'</I></font></td></tr></TABLE></td><td>In the photos above are two different flowers, and to prove it I took a photo of the two plants side by side.

fmart ("So, you want to be a Desert Rat?","Jim Daniel","It's easy.  Just dump your wife and kids into the family sedan, load in the camera and extra film, take plenty of bottled water, and a good supply of sunscreen would be appropriate.  The family sedan will be confined to paved and graded roads, but there is a plethora of places to visit in the Mojave Desert that are fun for the wife and kids and where you can look at cactus and other succulents to your hearts desire.</P><P>The seasoned Desert traveler will drive a high-clearance vehicle, such as a pickup truck or an SUV, will be well equipped with food and water, your favorite digging tools (mine is a rock hammer or a light pick).  A word on digging wild plants, you may only dig on private land with the owner's permission.  The owner of 90% of desert land is the State or Federal Government, so have a care!</P><P>The seasoned Desert traveler will wear stout hiking boots, tear resistant Levi jeans, long sleeved shirts and a straw hat with a wide brim.  Take along plenty of water and a cooler full of soft drinks for both you and your vehicle, plus food for snacks.  I like Beef Jerky; the salt keeps your energy level up.  Sam Keaton likes to snack on hard candy while he is driving along.</P><P>We will follow with several articles on where to go to see your favorite plants.");
