<P>
If you have been to our Country Store before, you know that this is one of the most fun events of the season.  It is a great opportunity for you to bring in plants, pots, associated items, or desserts to share with your fellow members.  (Bring in plants that you think other members would enjoy, unless you are looking forward to taking them back home yourself.  If you bring desserts, make certain that they are individually wrapped.)
</P>
<P>
Here is how it works.  First separate tables are set up for each category, Cacti, Succulents, Associated items, and Desserts.  Then we all buy tickets at five tickets for a dollar.  Members can use their tickets in whatever categories they like.  A board member for each table picks tickets, and each winning member in the order in which their ticket was selected gets their pick of what is on that table.  This is repeated until the Country Store is done or everyone dies laughing.

Due to business pressures, Manson Waters has had to resign his position as Vice President of our society.  Manson and Lynda have been members since the mid 1970s, and between them have filled virtually all board positions at one time or another.  They will remain members of the society, but their ability to be directly involved will be limited.  Their years of service to our society are gratefully acknowledged.  Lynda is the person who is responsible for my joining CSSSJ.
