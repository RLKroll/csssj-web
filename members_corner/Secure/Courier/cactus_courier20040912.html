<P>
Last June, Roger gave us an exhilarating talk on his travels through the eastern portion of South America focusing on the plants of Argentina.  Now, he will complete his presentation with his account of his adventures down the western coast of South America.
</P>
<P>
Roger has wide-ranging horticultural interests: Bromeliads, Succulent plants, and Orchids.  He has served as a judge for a variety of plant shows.  He has given several talks to our society before.
</P>
<P>
As most of us know, Chile is home to Copiapoa and a wide variety of unique and unusual cacti and succulents.

It is mostly on the east side of Baja and extends from close to the tip of Baja Sur to a little way into Baja North. The flowers are icing on the cake for the plant is quite beautiful when not in bloom.  The 4 central spines are in a cross shape with the longest spine pointing downward. The centrals can be up to 5 inches long. On the plant of mine that I am looking at the longest is at 2.5 inches.  The centrals are dagger or double-edged sword shaped. I have 3 different plants each with its own color of spines.  The one I am looking at has very light horn-colored spines.  The others have yellowish spines and the last has brownish pink spines.  The first time they bloomed I gave the flower a smell and was surprised with a pleasant sweet odor.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2>Being from mostly Southern Baja the plants want to be protected from frosts.  The big freeze of 90 killed several of my plants.  If any of you do not know what the plant looks like you can let me know and I will send you a photo.</td></tr><tr><td>Now we travel east to the Rio Grande River plain and on down into Mexico. Here we find <I>Echinocereus enneacanthus v. brevispinus</I>.  When not in bloom this plant is not the most exciting looking plant in the cactus world.  Let it bloom, and it becomes a top of the line plant.  When it blooms it does not waste time it really puts out flowers.  The flowers are suppose to be crimson with a darker center but like me you can call the color what ever you want.  The flowers are to almost 4 inches across.  You put anywhere from 20 to 75 of those flowers on a plant and you have one mass of color.  This plant blooms several times each summer.</td><td><TABLE><tr><td><img src='echinocereusenneacanthusvbrevispinuscl.jpg' width=320 height=240 hspace=0></td></tr><tr><td align=center><font size=-2 color='#6699CC'><I>Echinocereus enneacanthus v. brevispinus</I></font></td></tr></TABLE></td></tr></TABLE></center>");

fmart ("Jull's Giant","Jim Daniel","A few years ago, I paid a visit to Tom Jull in San Francisco to buy surplus plants.  The most interesting was a <I>Trichocereus pachanoi</I> that had been reduced to cuttings by a strong wind.</P><P>It was a giant, stems 10 feet tall and 7 inch in circumference.  I bought about 40 lineal feet of the plant and named it <I>Trichocereus pachanoi var. Jull's Giant.</I></P><P>Now I have come full circle, my plant was blown over by a strong wind the other night.  I now have 6 tip cuttings and 6 baloney sections to give away on a first-come first-served basis.  The baloney sections are good propagators.  You dig a shallow ditch long enough to accommodate the cutting, and lay it on its side.  The bottom areoles will produce roots, and the top areoles will produce pups.  Theoretically, each areole will produce a full-grown plant.</P><P><font size=-1>Pick up the cuttings at 1085 Tasman Drive #313, Sunnyvale CA.
