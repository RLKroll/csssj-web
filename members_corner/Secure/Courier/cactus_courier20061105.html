<B class="leadhead">Brian Kemble - South of the Border</B><br>
<br>
<P>
Our destination this month is actually way south of the border: Oaxaca in South Central Mexico.  Our program presenter is Brian Kemble, horticulturist of the Ruth Bancroft Garden in Walnut Creek.  Brian is known worldwide for his vast knowledge of xerophytic plants especially those of Mexico and South Africa.  Besides being a marvelous grower, he is an accomplished hybridizer, especially of <I>Aloes</I>.
<P>
</P>
The State of Oaxaca has a wonderful diversity of terrain -- high mountains, steep valleys, and hot, humid lowlands.  The many microclimates provide for a wealth of interesting plants.  A gifted photographer, Brian gives us an 'inside look' into the horticultural riches of this region.</P>

fmart ("Our First Fall Show &amp; Sale","Judy Goodrode","<TABLE><tr><td valign='top'>We set up the show differently than we do in the spring.  We had an area for the 3 classes, novice, advanced and open, then within each class we had cactus, succulent and display.  We colorized the entry forms.  Then we had the public vote on their favorite plant in each area.  The visitors were given stars to place on the entry forms as they choose their favorites.  It was fun to see the results as we did not have judges choose the plants based on the rarity or age or form, but what the people viewed as a special plant.  Thanks to all those who contributed and helped.  I hope next year in the fall we have more participants, as we now know that your favorite plant may win and it was just fun to show your plants.  The spring show will continue to be a formal judged show.</P><P><font size=-2>(Photograph by Chuck Breese)</font></P></td><td><img src='2006fall01.jpg' height=260 width=360></td></tr></TABLE>");

Although sales were not as high as they were in the spring we did have plenty of buyers.  Spending for what was wanted and choice material was brisk.</P><P>Again everything went very smoothly putting on the show and sale.  There were plenty of volunteers.  Personally, I found it a pleasure in that I had people helping bring in and setting up my sales table.  Again, I won't name names in fear of forgetting someone, but all that helped and participated, a big big thanks for a job excellently done.  And the sales resulted in a nice extra boost for the treasury putting our club in more solid financial footing.  Time for all to think of ways the club may wish to spend money on worthwhile endeavors to benefit us all in the hobby.</P><P>Don't forget that we have new and improved stylish CSSSJ tee shirts for sale at the meeting and at our December Holiday celebration.  A simple way to get your Holiday shopping completed.  Again another year is passing and again another Holiday party in December for our club.  There will be free large sized plants for all members and the collection of Clark Brown (<I>Haworthias</I>) will be raffled away to the members in remembrance.  Also there will be an auction of collectible plants (so you can have something choice to show at our April S&amp;S).  Again to make it short and sweet and not so drawn out, plants will be sold by silent auction and just the top 2 or 3 bidders will be able to bid when the plant comes up.  It is a time for members to get extra plants ready that they want to part with and put them up for sale.</P><P><font size=-2> (Photograph by Chuck Breese)</font>");
