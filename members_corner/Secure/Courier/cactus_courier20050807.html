fmart ("NORCAL Show and Sale","Bill Munkacsy","The Norcal Show and Sale was held on July 23<sup>rd</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup>.  The show area was nicely set up and had good participation.  The show and sale was well attended by viewers and buyers.  Interestingly, succulent plants outsold cacti by at least two to one.  Sales were comparable to previous years.  A lot of work went into this event, and the Norcal society should be rightfully proud of their effort and its results.");

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado","If there was a wanted poster for the person that killed the most lithops, I'm pretty sure that I would be on it.  Lithops are such cute little things that I find them hard to pass up.   So I buy them and invariably proceed to kill them.</P><P>Lithops are commonly known as &quot;living stones&quot; or &quot;living rocks&quot; and they come in a variety of earthy tones.  They originate from South Africa and Namibia where they have become highly adapted to extreme conditions. </P><P>I've seen Lithops on the desks of people that haven't got the skill to keep anything alive, and I've seen what a master grower can do with them.  I keep thinking that I ought to be able to do this.  I certainly have some skills when it comes to growing plants; I'm not a master, but I'm not a beginner, either.  They sell them at Home Depot, so how hard can it be? </P><P>In my pursuit of the answers for my terminal experiences, I have talked with many of the greats in the field.  Experience is, after all, the best teacher.  Their answers seem to always be the same:  &quot;<B>Don't</B>, I repeat, <B>don't</B> water them at all during the winter months,&quot; and &quot;keep them dry and <B>don't</B> ever, even a little bit, water them during the winter and spring months.&quot;  Then they always add, &quot;You'll get the hang of it in a couple of years.&quot;</P><P>So, it seems that my problem isn't that I'm a murderer, it's that I'm too nurturing and the poor little things just drown in my love.");

fmart ("Norcal Show and Sale","Bill Kurtz","The twelfth annual Norcal Cactus and Succulents Association Show and Sale in San Francisco was a very enjoyable extravaganza.  The crowds looked in awe at the show plants and gained inspiration to descend on the sales area with enthusiasm.  For those who did not attend this event, you missed a great show and the opportunity to shop for plants and pottery from both established favorites and five or more new vendors.  For the first time, I came home without having purchased a single plant, which is not a reflection on the variety and attractiveness of the plants that were for sale.  It was a situation of too much &quot;good stuff&quot; causing a case of sensory overload.</P><P>Bill Munkacsy received five Best in Show awards.  A huge container of <I>Ariocarpus</I> was judged the overall Best in Show.  Also garnering blue ribbons were Wes Briggs and Rowena Southwell.  Frank and Naomi Bloss brought a huge selection of first quality plants and won the sweepstakes award for highest number of plants receiving ribbons.  Included was the most vicious appearing <I>Opuntia</I> I have ever seen.  This plant gives new meaning to the question, &quot;How do you handle and transport that thing?&quot;");
