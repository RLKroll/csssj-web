<P>
This month, we will be exchanging stories about how and why we became involved with succulent plants.  Bring your favorite plant, a plant that has taxed your patience, or a plant about which you have a question.  Our more experienced members will be regaling us with tales of the early days of succulent plant collecting.  (Yes, they are that old.)  Newer members can take advantage of this opportunity to learn why that plant they cherished so attentively turned brown and shriveled into a ghastly imitation of itself.  This is your chance to enthrall your fellow enthusiasts with the details of how you raised that magnificent ribbon winner from a tiny seed or drugstore seedling.

fmart ("Prez Sez'","Bill Munkacsy","We are going to put on a second show and sale on October 7th and 8th.  Hopefully, this will become an annual event in addition to our spring show.  We hope to generate interest in our hobby and pique interest in cacti and succulents for our new members as well as in the public in general.  We hope that all of our members are interested in doing this.  We would like to have all members, new and old, voice their suggestions and become active in the direction of our club.  You can do this by volunteering for the club board or by giving a hand at club meetings.  For example, helping revive the mini show or at the show and sale showing some of your plants and volunteering your time.  This show will be informal (not a judged show) no hassles or pressure just for fun.  The whole idea of everything we do is to enjoy, have fun, and, by participating, you can have fun, too.");

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado"," Ever notice how everyone seems to have an idea about how things should be run?  Some gravitate toward the simple and others go all out.</P><P>Some people celebrate a birthday with cake and ice cream.  Others will hire a clown, put out streamers, rent a karaoke machine and have the whole event catered.  Still others just say &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and are done with it.</P><P>Theme parties are a strange part of our culture.  I go to one every year the weekend after New Years.  We get the invitation in lieu of a Christmas card, and it tells us what the theme is for that year.  It's a fun way to start the year out.  But, don't make the mistake of thinking that you can throw together a costume at the last minute; these things can be quite extravagant.  (And you will be sent home, if you don't come in costume.)</P><P>Take a look at the staging of a plant for a show.   Some people buy a hundred-dollar pot and maybe even transplant the thing several times before they are happy with their choice.  Rocks and drift wood are added for extra appeal.  And then, there are the people that have a plant in a plastic pot that is so understated that it doesn't distract from the plant in any way.  Their thought being that a beautiful plant is a beautiful plant, and it doesn't really need window dressing.   And still others will put a little green frog figurine in the corner, have colored gravel and maybe some straw flowers glued to the plant.   No adornment is too much for their little darlings.</P><P>Beauty is subjective and very personal.   The judging for shows may follow a ridged set of rules and still not pick the plant that you like the most.   My thought is that whatever you see and like the most is the real winner.  And my little green frog agrees with me.");
