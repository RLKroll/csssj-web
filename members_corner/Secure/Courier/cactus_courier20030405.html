fmart ("Get ready.  Get set.  Show!!!","Bill Kurtz","Let's not leave the show to the vendors.  Let's all try to have something for the show.  We need more participation in the Novice class.  They don't have to be in fancy containers with professional presentations.  Nice plants in clean pots will add immesurably to the success and quality of our show.    Don't forget about the Show Bucks and the special bonus Show Bucks for first-time exhibitors.</P><P>Here is a reminder of some of the details from last month's Courier:<UL type='circle'><li> Entering is not very hard.  We will have the rules, category lists, and entry forms at the next two meetings.  If you are confused about what to do, just ask around.  Many of us have shown before and would love to lend a hand to newcomers.  Showing is fun, and you can learn a lot about your plants from the judges if you show.<br><br></li><li>We will be awarding some very nice pottery to the winners this year.<br><br></li><li>We will be holding a special raffle for club members who are competing (showing one or more plants) in our show for the first time.  More details will appear in next month's Courier.<br><br></li><li>If you decide to enter plants in the show, you must bring them in to the show area between 5:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Friday, April 4th (no exceptions!).  You can pick them up after the show closes on Sunday, April 6th, after 5:00 p.m.<br><br></li><li>If you're a club member attending the show and sale, note that we put on a potluck/barbecue on both Saturday and Sunday.  The club provides the meat (hamburgers, hot-dogs, chicken) and the attendees bring a potluck dish to share.<br><br></li></UL>");

fmart ("Past Prez Sez'","Bill Kurtz","Ah, spring has sprung!  Warmer nights, warmer days.  Plants growing like mad - aphids invading.  Thrips appearing again to plague my Sansevierias.  Time to look over your beloved horticultural treasures.  New pots, new mixes.  Check for mealy bugs.  Brace yourself for the many, many shows and sales, tours, etc. in the coming months starting with the Monterey Bay Area C&SS (April 26 and 27) and ending hopefully with the CSSC (Oakland) Show and Sale later in the year.  These are just the central California activities.  You should see what the Southland has planned.</P><P>Our very important 34rd Show and Sale - April 5 and 6 - is fast, fast, fast approaching.  I encourage you all to show your plants.  The Novice class is a great starting point.  New exhibitors can learn the &quot;ropes&quot; in a low-pressure, friendly atmosphere and get show bucks, too.  It is important to show the public the joys of our hobby and hopefully they will buy lots of plants and pottery.</P><P>The revenue from our Show and Sale is a primary source of funds for club activities throughout the rest of the year.  It is so very important that we make this event successful to make possible all of the other programs that we enjoy.  Not to mention that being the people who make the Show and Sale a success is so much fun! ");
