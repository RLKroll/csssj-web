This year's Holiday Banquet will be held on Saturday, December 4, 2010, from 11:00am to 3:00pm at Harry's Hofbrau.  The restaurant is located at 390 Saratoga Avenue near Kiely Boulevard.  Their number is 408-243-0434.

<P>
Everyone who brings a plant puts it on the center table for the plant exchange.  A club officer will select the best plant which will be added to the auction plants.  The person who brought that plant is the first to select from the exchange.  Whoever brought the plant the first person picked picks next, and so forth until all the plants have been taken.  When all the plants are gone, the last person selects a plant from the gift plants.
</P>
<P>
There will be two categories of plants for the auction: plants under $20 and plants over $20.  For the plants under $20 the first person bidding $20 will get the plant.  The auction in this area will be silent; there will be a card next to the plant in which people will bid on the plant.  When time is up, only the top three bidders will be able to bid on the plant. Again the first person to bid $20 will get the plant.  This will be explained at the dinner so don't worry if you don't understand it now.  The plants over $20 will be handled the same way; only on both categories there will be a minimum bid that will be listed and bidding will start from the minimum bid.  Members can bring in their own plants for the auction.  If you are interested, contact Bill Munkacsy at 925-935-5213.
</P>
<P>
Members who renew at or before the December meeting will participate in a special plant raffle.

For years, there was confusion over what genus the plants we now know as <I>Ariocarpus fissuratus</I>, <I>A. fissuratus v. lloydii</I>, and <I>A. kotschoubeyanus</I> should be in.  Some die-hards still held on to <I>Roseocactus</I>, but <I>Ariocarpus</I> was slowly winning over <I>Roseocactus</I>.  Then the winning was dealt a setback, when the &quot;Cactus Lexicon&quot; by Curt Backeberg came out.  Backeberg defended the genus <I>Roseocactus</I> very strongly.  In the mid 1970s and early 1980s, more studies were done, and the plants under <I>Roseocactus</I> were again put under <I>Ariocarpus</I>.  The name <I>Roseocactus</I> has not completely died, as every so often I still see a plant with that name on it.  I have seen some nurseries offering <I>Roseocactus fissuratus</I> and the variety <I>lloydii</I>.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='ariocarpus fissuratus v lloydii.jpg' width=320 height=280 hspace=17 align='right'><br><I>A. fissuratus v. lloydii</I> differs from <I>A. fissuratus</I> in that its tubercle groove only extends about half way down the tubercle.  It is also a more rounded plant than <I>A. fissuratus</I>.  <I>A. fissuaratus</I>, when grown right, is more of a flat growing plant.  Its habitat is in Mexico, where <I>A. fissuratus</I> also grows in southern Texas.  The plant in the photo is 16 cm in diameter and 12 cm tall.</P><P>Soil has to drain quickly.  It needs to be in a deep enough pot to accommodate the tuberous root, but not much deeper.  Never keep the soil wet or damp.  Allow it to dry between waterings.  The flowers appear in late summer to mid fall.  They are 5 to 6 cm across.  The seed pods appear the next summer.</td></tr></TABLE>");

Naomi demonstrated techniques such as pruning, dividing, and making cuttings.  We discussed fertilizing, pest control, potting mixes, and top dressings - and where to get them.  She also demonstrated how to take a plant and get it ready for show as the audience helped to decide which pots resulted in the greatest effect.

fmart ("Picture Pages on the CSSSJ Web Site","Rich Kroll","We have added four picture pages to the CSSSJ web site (<a href='http://www.csssj.org'>www.csssj.org</a>).  A link to these pages has been added to the header menu.  The pages are &quot;Show and Sale&quot; (pictures of plants, people, etc. from the Show and Sale), &quot;Cacti and Succulents&quot; (pictures of any succulent plant), &quot;Something Special&quot; (special pictures related in any way to our hobby or club), and &quot;In the Ground&quot; (pictures of succulent plants in landscaping or in their natural habitat).</P></P><center><img src='piclink01.jpg' width=593 height=136></center></P><P>Here is how the pages work:</P><P>For each picture, there is an entry with a thumbnail (a small version of the picture), its description, the name of the photographer, and the name of the grower.  Under the thumbnail, is the estimated size of the picture in K (kilobytes).  The size is provided to give the viewer a reasonable expectation of how long it should take for the full picture to be displayed.  Clicking on the thumbnail will display the full-size picture.</P><P>There is a &quot;Submit Your Picture&quot; link on the index page and each picture page.  This leads to a page with instructions on how to submit your picture for inclusion on one of the picture pages.  You must be a member of the club to submit a picture.</P><P>Underneath each thumbnail is a &quot;Vote for this Picture&quot; button.  This button allows club members to vote for the pictures they like.  Club members can vote for as many pictures as they like, but they cannot vote for the same picture more than once.</P><P>Voting is very important.  Each picture starts with a two month life on its page.  For every vote a picture gets, its life is extended by an additional month.  This way, the members of the club decide how long a picture stays on our web site and consequently the quality of the pictures we display to our visitors.  If the members do not vote, the pages will quickly empty, and we will have no pictures to show.  That would be a shame, since the members of our club grow and photograph some of the most impressive specimens of succulent plants anywhere.");
