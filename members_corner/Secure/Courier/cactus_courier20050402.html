fmart ("Prez Sez","Bill Munkacsy","One of the big challenges for this or any C&amp;S club is to get and retain new members.  It takes a lot of people to put on a show and sale and a critical number of active people are needed.  We need to put on a good show to get interest in our hobby and for people to be enthused.  New members often come from our show.  I am trying to show that there is a circle here; and to start the circle going in the right direction it is imperative to put our best foot forward during our show.  All current members should think of our show as their own personal open house. All of us need to do our part to have this event go as well as possible.  A lot of people are volunteering.  One thing all members can do is decorate the house; to bring and share their plants with others at the show.  It takes time and effort, but the effort is rewarding to the club and to you personally.  If you have never shown before, you will find it fun and informative.  Please do not be shy; please give showing a try!  We will feed you dinner Friday, and you will get first crack at plants for sale.  We also have a great lunch Saturday, the best of any club I know.  The club is counting on your support and help.  I am confident that you will enjoy the experience.  Please put aside April 1, 2, and 3 and join us for the show, and please bring your show plants!");

fmart ("So, you want to be a Desert Rat?","Jim Daniel","<TABLE cellspacing=7><tr><td colspan=2>This is to be the shortest trip.  You can make it in two days, or you can join it with a few others and stretch it out as long as you like.  If you drive down I-5 to Bakersfield, you can enjoy the Deadly Datura (Jimson Weed) flowering beside the road. The flowers are white and striking, but they close up about 10:00 am.  (It is a night bloomer.)  Another plant to look for is Russian Thistle (Tumbling Weed).  The best time for viewing it is in the fall, when it dances with the wind.<br></td></tr><tr><td>Take the Bakersfield turn off (Route 58).  Go past Bakersfield and stay on 58.  When you see the last of the Orange Trees, you have come to the Caliente River.  It is hard to recognize, because there usually is no water in it.  <I>Opuntia basilaris v. Treleasei</I> grows on the riverbanks.  As you continue on, the road climbs quickly.  When you are about half way up the Tehachapi Mountains, you see clumps of <I>Yucca whipplei</I> (The Lords Candle).  They are striking in bloom.</td><td rowspan=2><img src='mojave.gif' width=391 height=348 border=1></td></tr><tr><td>When you arrive on the east side of the mountains, you have arrived at the desert.  You can see large stands of <I>Yucca brevifolia</I>.  The early Mormons thought it was like Joshua supplicating the Lord.  Interesting side trips can be made to the Santa Fe railroad lines at the Tehachapi Loop.  The story goes that the conductor on the last car of a train handed the engineer in the locomotive a cup of coffee as he rolled past.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2>The Alabama Hills are interesting.  Hollywood used it as a backdrop to shoot Western movies.  Turn left on Highway 14. Another good place to visit is Red Rock Canyon, if you enjoy hiking.  It is located along the same stretch of highway.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2>Enjoy yourselves, it's later than you think.</td></tr></TABLE>");

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado","When the position of Club Librarian became available I jumped at the opportunity.  (Well, maybe not jumped.  More like was pushed.)  Anyway, I was getting ready to move into a new house that I was going to have an extra room in, so I thought that I might really enjoy doing it.  I've always loved books and cacti are a major source of enjoyment in my life.  I could fill a role in the club that was needed and have all of those great books at my disposal any time that I wanted them.  It seemed the natural and smart thing to do.  But, of course every great idea has a down side.  What I didn't realized at the time was that many of the books that I was taking home were books that I already had.  And, everyone always wants the really heavy ones! This job ought to come with a forklift.</P><P>While I love the cactus world with very few limits, I'm not the most informed in the field.  I have a lot of plants, but it's kind of an eclectic collection of plants that I saw and just liked.  (Or that were given to me.)  So, when I get a call from a club member about a book that deals with a certain plant I'm pretty well useless.  But, I have the room for the books, and I don't really mind hauling them to the meeting.  So, I'm pretty sure that I won't get fired.</P><P>So, give me a call when you want me to bring a book to the meeting for you to check out.  Don't be surprised when I complain that you always want the heavy ones, because they're all heavy ones.  And please remember that this is what I do for fun.  I didn't get the job because I was the most qualified; I got it because I was the only one that was willing to do it.");
