<br>
<P>
If you have been to our Country Store before, you know that this is one of the most fun events of the season.  It is a great opportunity for you to bring in plants, pots, associated items, or desserts to share with your fellow members.  (Bring in plants that you think other members would enjoy, unless you are looking forward to taking them back home yourself.  If you bring desserts, make certain that they are individually wrapped.)
</P>
<P>
Here is how it works.  First separate tables are set up for each category, Cacti, Succulents, Associated Items, and Desserts.  Then we all buy tickets at five tickets for a dollar.  Members can use their tickets in whatever categories they like.  A board member for each table picks tickets, and each winning member in the order in which their ticket was selected gets his or her pick of what is on that table.  This is repeated until the Country Store is done or everyone dies laughing.
</P>
<P>
No MiniShow is planned for this meeting because of the Country Store.  Of course, if you have something of particular interest, you are welcome to bring it.
</P>

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado","Most of us have heard the proverb &quot;It takes a village to raise a child.&quot;   I'd like to change that to &quot;It takes a village to put on a show and sale.&quot;</P><P>We've all enjoyed the fruits of our club's labors by coming to our show and sale.  It is truly amazing to see what some of our fellow growers can accomplish with the same plants that I have.  Mine always look good and people that see them are impressed by my skills, but mine are nothing when compared to the skilled nurturing of some of our fellow members. They're an inspiration to us all.  Clerking is fun and educational.</P><P>The sale tables are packed full of tempting items.  Many of the plants are one-of-a-kind.  It still amazes me when I find a plant that I haven't ever seen before.  But, it doesn't stop at just the plants being for sale; the expertise of the growers and their willingness to guide the newbie is really very impressive.</P><P>A few years ago we started a &quot;mentoring&quot; program.  The benefits were two-fold: the growers got help getting ready for the sale and the helpers got to spend time among the plants learning from the true Masters.  I spent some time with Rowena.  I learned how to take a large plant and cut it into a bunch of future plants.  I learned how to clean and repot on a larger scale then I ever would at home.  But, most of all, I learned that there is no way that I could ever work as hard as our growers do.  The respect that I went away with was worth more to me than I can tell.  And, you know the really funny thing is that they love doing it.  Oh, don't get me wrong, they do have risks.  Who doesn't remember the frost that we had several years ago?  Or, the drought? Or, El Nino?  Or, countless other risks that go along with everyday living?  And, don't even bring up having to move!!!</P><P>Hospitality is a highly valued part of our show and sale.  The coffee really is a life saver, the donuts are heavenly, and all love the barbeque.  Security is a must!  The thought of having a prized plant walked away with is frightening.  And, let's not forget the boxes that make the shopping so much easier!  The cash register and packing up the purchases for safe travel home can make or break the sale.  Setting up and tearing down is hard work, but made easier when we all pitch in.</P><P>So, if you would like to be a part of our &quot;village&quot; you can volunteer to help out.  You can drag your friends and family along just for the fun of it.  (I drag mine!)  See any of the officers or &quot;Seasoned&quot; club members - or even me, and see if you have a skill that we can use.  If you don't have a skill, we'll help you find one.  It really does &quot;take a village to put on a show and sale.&quot;");
