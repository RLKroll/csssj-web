fmart ("Past Prez Sez","","On February 22nd, there was a terrible fire at the Buchser Middle School, our hosts for the annual show and sale.  The destruction to the science department was total and other facilities were extensively damaged.  The room we will be using for our show and sale was not damaged and our sale will go on as scheduled.  However, the aftermath of this fire may affect parking for the show and sale.  I will provide more information as it becomes available.</P><P>Anyone who has science books, books on how things work, aquariums, art supplies, and anything else that would be useful to a school science or art department please contact Bill Kurtz (408-243-3692) for information on how and when to donate this material.");

fmart ("2004 SHOW & SALE UPDATE","Bill Gingras","Only one more month to go until the 35th Annual CSSSJ Show and Sale.  The show and sale is being held on April 3rd and 4th this year, with set up on the 2nd.</P><P>Volunteer sign-ups are light in some areas.  In fact, we do not have enough volunteers in any given area yet, but we are especially light in volunteers for Staging, Clerking, and Security.  Please plan on volunteering at the Show and Sale.  It's fun, you'll earn &quot;Show Bucks&quot; worth $5.00 for your efforts, and it's just the right thing to do for the club.  The Show and Sale nets more funding for the club's activities than any other event during the year.</P><br><P><I>There are several ways that you can sign up, or inquire about volunteering: </I><OL><li>Judy and I will be circulating a volunteer sign-up list at the March meeting, where you can sign up in person.</li><br><br><li>If you cannot make the meetings, but have access to the World-Wide-Web or email, go to the club's web site (<a href='http://www.csssj.org'>www.csssj.org</a>), click on the &quot;Member's Corner&quot; link that is near the top of the page, then click the &quot;Show & Sale Stuff&quot; link.  In the Enter Network Password screen that appears, type &quot;csssj&quot; for the User Name, and &quot;2iljh7&quot; (without the quotes) for the Password.  Among the links on that page is a &quot;Volunteering at the Show and Sale&quot; link that will take you to a page that explains the various volunteer positions that we need staffed.  You can send an email to <a href='mailto:webmaster@csssj.org'>webmaster@csssj.org</a> to sign up, or to ask further questions.</li><br><br><li>Don't have web access or email?  Feel free to give Judy Goodrode or Bill Gingras a call.  We are both listed in the CSSSJ directory.  We'll answer questions, provide the necessary details and add you to the list.</li></OL></P><br><P><I>Some other Show/Sale-related items.... </I></P><P><UL type='circle'><li>Please consider showing some of your plants. Entering is not at all difficult. If you have web access, follow the instructions above to get to the &quot;Show & Sale Stuff&quot; page.  On that page, you'll find a downloadable version of the 2004 show rules and categories, and a primer that explains how to enter plants in the show.  We will also have the rules/categories and entry cards at the March meeting.  Unfortunately, because the entry cards are color-coded, I am not including them on the web site, but you can pick some up at the March meeting.  They will also be available the night before the show opens while we are setting up.  Note that if you fill them out on Friday night, you need to have them finished and your plants set out by 7:30 pm.</li><br><br><li>If you're a club member attending the show and sale, note that we put on a potluck/barbecue on both Saturday and Sunday.  The club provides the meat (hamburgers, hot-dogs, chicken) and the attendees bring a potluck dish to share.</li></UL>");
