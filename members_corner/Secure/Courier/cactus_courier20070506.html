<P>
Every one of us cannot resist that particular plant calling to us from the sale tables at the Show and Sale.  If we could, we would not be members of this club.  This meeting is going to be all about sharing with your fellow members the allure that drew you to that special plant.  Maybe you know precisely why that cactus or succulent called to you; maybe you do not have a clue.   Sharing the experience with the rest of the club may just be the thing that will give you an insight into your own thought processes.  In any case, bring that plant with you to the meeting, and we can all revel in our good fortune and exquisite taste.

fmart ("Prez Sez'","Linda Delgado","Have you ever had a really bad day that made you want to go back to bed, pull the covers over your head, and just close your eyes and sleep until it all goes away?  Days like this happen, and the difference between giving into despair and overcoming it may be within your reach, if you just make the effort.</P><P>When my kids were teenagers, I had many days when I thought that I had made the biggest mistake of my life to become a parent.  One time it was so bad that I decided that I needed to get away for a while or I would be on the six o'clock news.  I got about a block away from my house and found a quarter on the ground.  A couple more blocks, and I saw a humming bird nest in a tree that had a baby humming bird in it.  Stepping away from my problems for a few minutes turned a disastrous day into one of my favorite days.</P><P>I lived in a rented house for 27 years.  I reared my children, planted a cactus garden, and had two dogs.  This house was my home, and I thought that I had it all.  Then my landlord passed away, and his children told me that I had 30 days to get out.  I was devastated.  This event gave me the incentive to get out and buy a house.  Although it didn't turn out to be the house of my dreams, it did show me that I could do it and that I could overcome the feeling that I was at loose ends.  It was up to me to make my way.</P><P>My children are the loves of my life.  At 38 and 36, they still live with me and Roy has given me the daughter of my heart with Lyndsey.  Jim is probably my best friend in the world, and I enjoy spending time with him.  But sometimes I need to get away and enjoy the company of people that share some of my &quot;outside&quot; interests.  The Cactus and Succulent  Society of San Jose has been a place that I can step away from the trials and tribulations of everyday life.  It is a place where I can go and share my love of plants, my thirst for knowledge, and my joy in having friends that share my interests.</P><P>So, the next time that you think your day may end up being beyond perfect, step away and see what lies on the other side of the block.  Enjoy the world around you and share your joy with your friends.  Make the effort to be a part of the world that we live in instead of just being an observer.  There are many opportunities in our club and our world.  You just have to make the effort.");

fmart ("Bill Kurtz Fell","Rich Kroll","By now most of us have heard that Bill fell and broke his hip.  It is hard not to notice Bill's absence.  It seems as if whenever this club has a success, Bill had something to do with the planning, execution, or logistics.  I am editing this month's newsletter without Bill's help.  That is a first for me.  Bill has always been there making certain that I do not fail or telling me not to obsess over the mistakes I make.  That made editing the newsletter a lot easier for me.  I will be glad when he gets back to being the Curmudgeon that Enabled Christmas.");
