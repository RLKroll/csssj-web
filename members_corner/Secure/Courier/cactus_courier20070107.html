<P>
To make it easier for members to participate in our next Show, we are going to have demonstrations on staging plants for show in January, several months before our April Show.  This will give members who want to show their plants a longer lead-time to complete their own staging and have their plants grow into their new homes.

fmart ("Prez Sez'","Linda Delgado","There are times in all of our lives when we must take the bull by the horns and hold on for dear life.  Hopefully, when the dust settles, we will be better for the experience and will have come through without hurting ourselves or the bull.</P><P>I only say this because I have the honor of being the President of our club for the next two years.  You, in your reckless disregard for order, have chosen me to fill some pretty big shoes.  I'm not sure if it's one of those &quot;warm body&quot; kind of situations or if you see something in me that may or may not really be there.</P><P>When researching what I was getting myself into, I looked up the word &quot;president&quot; in the dictionary.  It's a noun.  Okay, so far, so good.  It says that it is one appointed or elected to preside over an organized body of people, such as an assembly or meeting.  Not so bad.  It went on to list several other names that a President can go by: CEO, Commander in Chief, Champion, Chairman, Head of State, Boss, Captain and Skipper.  Funny, but Goddess wasn't there.</P><P>It has been said that a leader is only as good as the people that he or she leads.  If this is the truth, I shall be an excellent leader, because you are all good people.  I know that each and every one of you will step up to the plate when asked.  And I will ask, because we all want a thriving club where we have great guest speakers, fun club activities and show and sales events that have everyone talking for months.  Fresh ideas always make for a more interesting club.</P><P>So, work with me and my fellow board members to make our club the best that it can be.  We can do it together, and that's no bull.");

The stems are 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter and 2 to 10 cm long.  After the plant blooms, it grows more stem joints that usually fall off and is the plant's principal way of propagation.  Growing over a large area, there are many different forms.  Some with no spines.  Some with spines to 2.5 cm long.  Some have leaves only a few millimeters long. Other forms have leaves to 2 cm or a bit over.  The flowers are to 4 cm across.
