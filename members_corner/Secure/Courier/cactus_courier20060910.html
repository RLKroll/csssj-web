<br>
<P>
The date for our first Fall Show &amp; Sale is approaching fast.  Sign-up sheets will be passed around for the various positions that we will need to fill to make this event successful.  Having complete coverage for security is of paramount importance and an area in which we have had problems in previous shows.  We need people to sign up as cashiers, cashier assistants, for Friday night set-up, and for Sunday clean up.  As in the Spring Show & Sale, there will be a delicious barbecue for the workers on Saturday and Sunday.  Food will be provided for the Friday night set-up workers.

Bill Munkacsy will be presenting a program on one of his favorite genus, <I>Copiapoa</I>, including a slide presentation on plants and habitat.  He will bring some of his marvelous show plants and a nice selection of sale plants, too.  (Note that nice plants purchased now will satisfy the six-month ownership requirement for our Spring Show.)

It has some real industrial spines.  The central spine is a heavy duty hook. 3.5 cm long.  The centrals are in a complete circle but the top half for 180 degrees is heavy duty spines.  Some of these spines have a very slight backward curve.  In the bottom half of the circle of radials, are three heavy hooked spines.  The middle one is, in most cases, facing straight at the plant body.  The other two hooks are turned about at a 45 degree angle toward the middle spine.  So you will know more what this looks like, I added a photo of the spine clusters.  The spines are horn colored and a dark ruby red.</td></tr></TABLE></td></tr></TABLE><TABLE cellpadding=8><tr><td width='10%'></td><td valign='top'><center><TABLE><tr><td><img src='glandulicactus mathssoni.jpg' width=320 height=240 hspace=0></td></tr><tr><td align='center'><font size=-2 color='#6699CC'><I>Glandulicactus mathssoni</I></font></td></tr></TABLE></center></td><td valign='top'><br>Plant body is about 14 cm in diameter and about the same tall.

One place I worked had lots of Hoyas, and I learned quite quickly not to get too close to the flowers.  I just did not like being covered with the syrup, sticky drippings, honey dew, call it what you may, of the flowers.  I have to admit that Hoyas do have very interesting flower clusters.  When not blooming they just hang there and grow these trailing stems that you can get tangled up in.  I got caught in one and between the sticky dew and the tangle of stems it took me three days to get free.  From what I see in a book on the plants, they come from the more tropical areas of the southern parts of the planet.</td><td valign='top'><center><TABLE><tr><td><img src='hoya sp.jpg' width=320 height=240 hspace=0></td></tr><tr><td align='center'><font size=-2 color='#6699CC'><I>Hoya sp.</I></font></td></tr></TABLE></center></td></tr></TABLE></td></tr></TABLE></center>");

fmart ("Prez Sez'","Bill Munkacsy","First, be careful when playing baseball.  Now is the time when our plants have their most remarkable growth in general, as long as its not a winter grower.  Make sure you water and fertilize generously now till we cool off which is about Oct 15.  And, enjoy your plants.  Time to get ready for our show and sale.  My talk will go over <I>Copiapoas</I> with pictures from habitat and show plants staged as demonstration.  It will be unique and informative.  I gave the talk to the Sacramento club and they seemed to enjoy it a lot.  Hope to see you Sunday.");

He left about 1/3 of his nursery stock of plants behind.  Some are small (in about 4&quot; pots) and some up to commercial landscaping size.  We know only a handful of the plant names.  We would like to clean up the property, but cannot do much until these plants are removed.</P><P>The address is 21030 Gardena Dr. Cupertino, 95014-1616.
