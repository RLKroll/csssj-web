<P>
The February program will be a hands-on affair with members working with an all-star group of experts to learn how to present their favorite plants in the best way for showing.  Naomi Bloss will demonstrate her winning techniques with her own and your plants and pottery.
</P>
<p>
We strongly encourage attendees to bring their own plants - Please! - And work with our presenters to gain insight into the methods used to stage plants for the show.
</P>
<p>
A potting medium (no charge) will be available.  Top dressing, surplus plants from our Holiday party, and some pots will be available for sale, as will some of our club's surplus plants and beautiful pottery.  Participants also should try to bring some rocks, weathered wood, etc. to include in the presentation.  Although the staging represents a small percentage (5% - 10%) of the total points in judging, that's enough to produce a winner in a close race.
</P>
<p>
Even if you don't plan to show your plants in competition, it's nice to give them a treat and present them to yourself and friends in the best possible way.  (Think mini-show.)
</P>
<p>
The Bloss's California Succulents will be providing some of their marvelous plants for sale, too.

fmart ("South America Cactus Expeditions","","My name is Guillermo Rivera.  I am from Cordoba Argentina, and organize trips and expeditions in northern Argentina to see cactus in their habitat.  More than 100 species of cactus were seen in our last tour in October 2003.  Sixteen people, (Americans and French), participated in our last expedition.  Twelve days, all inclusive 925 Euros (ground transportation, hotels, park fees, all meals included).  Please visit <a href='http://www.cactusexpeditions.com.ar'>www.cactusexpeditions.com.ar</a> for additional information, itinerary, list of species and dates.

fmart ("2004 SHOW & SALE UPDATE","Bill Gingras","The 35th Annual CSSSJ Show and Sale is rapidly approaching.  Our show and sale is being held on April 3rd and 4th this year, with set up on the 2nd.</P><P>Despite the fact that last year's show and sale was held in early April instead of the usual weekend in May, it turned out to be our best show and sale in recent memory.  Well over 300 plants were entered, we had six new exhibitors, and eleven vendors.</P><P>Let's make this year's show and sale even better!</P><P> February marks the beginning of the Show Committee's annual volunteer drive. As you are well aware, the show and sale is very much a volunteer effort. Please plan on lending a hand this year. We volunteers always have lots of fun, and lots of volunteers makes for less work and more fun for everybody.</P><br><P><I>Signing up to be a volunteer is as easy as 1-2-3:</I><OL><li>Judy and I will be circulating a volunteer sign-up list at the February and March meetings, where you can sign up in person.<br><br></li><li>If you cannot make the meetings, but would still like to help out, please give Judy Goodrode or Bill Gingras a call.  We'll give you the necessary details and add you to the list.<br><br></li><li>If you have email access, you can also send an email to <a href='mailto:webmaster@csssj.org?subject=Show%20and%20Sale%20Volunteer'>webmaster@csssj.org</a> to sign up, or to ask questions about the positions we need volunteers for.  Currently, we need volunteers for set-up, staging, clerking, security, and tear-down.</OL></P><br><P><I>Here are some other Show/Sale-related items:</I><UL type='circle'><li>If you volunteer to work at least one shift at the show and sale, you earn a &quot;Show Bucks&quot; coupon worth $5.00 that you can use to buy plants with at the show, or to use for certain club functions such as raffles.<br><br></li><li>A bonus for people who volunteer to help us with set-up or staging, or for people who enter plants in the show, is that you get &quot;first dibs&quot; on sale plants.  Some plants on the sale tables are one-of-a-kind or in very limited quantities, and by being on site on Friday night, you can choose plants before the show opens to the general public (note that this is specifically NOT an invitation to the general club membership to come by and shop early; it is for set-up/staging volunteers and show entrants only).<br><br></li><li>Please consider showing some of your plants.  Briefly, if you have cacti or succulents in your collection that you really like, are presentable (that is, don't have scarring, etiolation, bugs, etc.), and are nicely potted, chances are that the public will really like them too.  If you have some favorite plants at home, but are not sure of how &quot;showable&quot; they are, take advantage of the staging workshop we'll be hosting at this month's meeting.<br><br></li><li>Entering is not at all difficult.  We will have the rules, category lists, and entry forms at the next two meetings.  I plan to include an article in the March Courier on entering plants into the show.  Also, many club members have shown plants before and would love to lend a hand to newcomers.  Showing is fun, and you can learn a lot about your plants from the judges, if you show.<br><br></li><li>We will be awarding some very nice pottery to the winners, and are introducing a new award category this year - &quot; Best <I>Aizoaceae</I>&quot; - for all you Mesemb buffs out there.<br><br></li><li>If you decide to enter plants in the show, you must bring them in to the show area between 5:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Friday, April 2nd (no exceptions!), and you can pick them up after the show closes on Sunday, April 4th, no sooner than 5:00 p.m.<br><br></li><li>If you're a club member attending the show and sale, note that we put on a potluck/barbecue on both Saturday and Sunday.  The club provides the meat (hamburgers, hot-dogs, chicken) and the attendees bring a potluck dish to share.</li></UL>");
