<P>
Mark Muradian's grandfather started farming in the San Joaquin Valley in 1915.  Mark still carries on his family's tradition.  He has been cultivating cacti and succulents for nearly 20 years.  He is a frequent and popular presenter to our club.
</P>
<P>
This time, he is regaling us with a presentation on his recent trip to Argentina.  He was accompanied on this excursion by Woody Minnich, Frank and Naomi Bloss, Roger Lane, Marilyn Moyer, Peder Samuelson, and many others.
</P>
<P>
He will bring a variety of his fine, handmade pots for sale just in time for you to be able to repot that prizewinning plant for the Show.

fmart ("2006 Show and Sale Update","Bill Gingras","The 37th Annual CSSSJ Show and Sale is rapidly approaching.  Our show and sale is being held on April 1st and 2nd this year, with set up on the March 31st.</P><P>As you are well aware, the show and sale is very much a volunteer effort.  Please plan on lending a hand this year, as lots of volunteers makes for less work and more fun for everybody.</P><P>Signing up to be a volunteer is as easy as 1-2-3:</P><P><OL><li>The volunteer sign-up list will be circulating at the February and March meetings, where you can sign up in person.</li><li>If you cannot make the meeting, but have access to the World-Wide-Web or email, go to the club's website (<a href='http://www.csssj.org'>www.csssj.org</a>), click on the &quot;Member's Corner&quot; link that is near the top of the page, then click the &quot;Show &amp; Sale Stuff&quot; link.  In the Enter Network Password screen that appears, type &quot;csssj&quot; for the User Name, and &quot;2iljh7&quot; (without the quotes) for the password.  Among the links on that page is a &quot;Volunteering at the Show and Sale&quot; link that will take you to a page that explains the various volunteer positions that we need staffed.  You can send an email to <a href='mailto:webmaster@csssj.org?Subject=Show%20and%20Sale'>webmaster@csssj.org</a> to sign up, or to ask further questions.</li><li>Don't have web access or email?  Feel free to give Bill Gingras a call.  He is listed in the CSSSJ directory.  He'll answer questions, provide the necessary details and add you to the list.</li></OL></P><P>Here are some other Show/Sale-related items:<TABLE cellspacing=8><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>If you volunteer to work at least one shift at the show and sale, you earn a &quot;Show Bucks&quot; coupon worth $5.00 that you can use to buy plants with at the show, or to use for certain club functions such as raffles.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>A bonus for people who volunteer to help us with set-up or staging, or for people who enter plants in the show, is that you get &quot;first dibs&quot; on sale plants.  Some plants on the sale tables are one-of-a-kind or in very limited quantities, and by being on site on Friday night, you can choose plants before the show opens to the general public (note that this is specifically NOT an invitation to the general club membership to come by and shop early; it is for set-up/staging volunteers and show entrants only).</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>Please consider showing some of your plants. Briefly, if you have cacti or succulents in your collection that you really like, are presentable (that is, don't have scarring, etiolation, bugs, etc.), and are nicely potted, chances are that the public will really like them too.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>Entering plants in the show is not at all difficult.  If you have web access, follow the instructions above in this article to get to the &quot;Show &amp; Sale Stuff&quot; link.  On that page, you'll find a downloadable version of the 2006 show rules and categories, and a primer that explains how to enter plants in the show.  We will also have the rules and categories and entry cards at the February and March meetings. Unfortunately, because the entry cards are color-coded, we are not including them on the web site, but you can pick some up at the February and March meetings.  They will also be available the night before the show opens while we are setting up.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>If you decide to enter plants in the show, you must bring them in to the show area between 5:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Friday, March 31st (no exceptions!), and you can pick them up after the show closes on Sunday, April 2nd, no sooner than 4:00 p.m.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='flowericon.gif' width=19 height=17></td><td>If you're a club member attending the show and sale, note that we put on a potluck/barbecue on both Saturday and Sunday.  The club provides the meat (hamburgers, hot-dogs, chicken) and the attendees bring a potluck dish to share.</td></tr></TABLE>");
