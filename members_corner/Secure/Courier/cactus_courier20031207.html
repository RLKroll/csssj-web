<P>
This year's Holiday Banquet will be held on December 7, 2003, from 11:00am to 4:00pm at Harry's Hoffbrau.  (Note: Harry's now accepts MasterCard and Visa.  Currently, they are having difficulties with their on-site ATM machine.)  The restaurant is located at 390 Saratoga Avenue near Kiely Boulevard.  Harry's telephone number is 408-243-0434.

<P>
We will have the plant exchange again this year.  Here is how it works.  Everyone who brings one puts their plant on the table in the center of the room.  The first person to pick selects the plant they want.  Whoever brought that plant picks next, and so forth until all the plants have been picked.  Obviously, the more desirable the plant you bring, the earlier you will get to pick.
</P>
<P>
There are two ways to have plants in the always-popular auction.  Plants donated to the society are very appreciated.  The alternative is a 70/30 split between the grower and the society respectively.  (Growers can specify minimum starting bids.)  Auction plants will be classified either in the budget class ($20 or less) or in the luxury class (more than $20).
</P>
<P>
There will be small give-away plants for everyone at the tables.  There will be the usual plant raffles, as well.
</P>
<P>
To allow us to make appropriate reservations with the restaurant, please contact Bill Kurtz at 408-243-3692 to let him know how many people you will be bringing to the Christmas banquet.

fmart ("Grower's Garden","Elton Roberts","<TABLE cellpadding=17><td><img src='buiningiabrevicylindrica.jpg' width=320 height=240 align='left' hspace=9></td><td>From Brazil comes the short cylinder cactus. &quot;Brevi&quot; means short and &quot;cylindrica&quot; means cylinder like or shaped.  <I>Buiningia brevicylinderica</I> is a plant that people think has something wrong with it when it grows its cephalium.  This is just one more thing that makes cactus so interesting.  From out of the cephalium grows the flower buds.  You can see a green bud just down from the top of the cephalium and in about the middle of it.  A few hours after the photo was taken the flower opened.  The flower is a light yellow green.  A well draining soil is a must and winter temperature of 40 degrees or above to keep the plant from being unhappy.</td></tr><tr><td><I>Islaya</I> short cylinder (<I>brevicylindrica</I>) is another South American cactus, but it comes from the other side of the Andes in Peru.  A number of years ago some one decided that <I>Islayas</I> are nothing but <I>Neoporterias</I>, and there they lived until someone else that wanted their name in print came along and decided that they are nothing but <I>Eriosyce</I>.  Each time they were moved there were less names.  Now there are only a couple left, if you can find them in the confusion of today's books.  I expect that very soon someone is going to discover that all cactus are just cactus, and we will have life made so much easier with just one name for the plants.  That will probably be <I>Cactus cactus</I>.  That way you would never be wrong in naming your plants.  If you wanted to order plants through a catalog you would never get the plant you wanted, but at least you will get a cactus.</P><P>Well draining soil and keep above freezing and the <I>Islaya</I> will be happy.</td><td><img src='islayabrevicylindrica.jpg' width=320 height=240></td></tr></TABLE>");

fmart ("What's Bugging You?","Jim Daniel","I made a trip to Michoacan in search of <I>Backebergia militaris</I>.  I arrived in the village of Presa Del Infirnenillo (Dam on the Inferno) late in the day.  I was getting low on gas.  So, I cruised through the village a couple of times looking for a gas station or a house with 50 gallon drums around it.  I finally found a house and stopped to inquire about petrol.  Sure enough they had some to sell.  While I was getting gassed up, I was approached by a young man wanting to sell me some marihuana.  I turned down his offer and continued with my fill-up.  When I left, I drove down to the Rio Balsas to make camp and perhaps take a swim in the cool water coming from the dam.  Lo and behold here comes the <I>marahuno</I> with back up and again offers me a truck load at a reasonable price.  Again, I said no.  Then I got a little spooked.  What if they came down at night and slit my throat thinking that I was carrying a big wad of cash.  Discretion got the best of valor.  So, I drove ten miles out in the desert on a bad dirt road to make camp.  I parked on the top of a large hill so I could see anyone coming.</P><P><center>(To be continued. . .)</center>");
