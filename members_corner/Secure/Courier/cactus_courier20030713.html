<B class="leadhead">Tour of Growers for July</B><br>
<P>
Back by popular demand, we will be having a tour of local growers for our July meeting.  This tour will focus on two growers in the Monterey Bay area.  Many are known by their vendor activities at our and other cacti and succulent sales, but their growing yards have not been visited by most of our members.
<P>
</P>
The tour will start at Anne Shein's house at 3360 Drew Street in Marina (831-384-7765).  Please get to Anne's house around 10:00am.  Next we will meet at the Central Texan BBQ for buy-your-own lunch at 10500 Merritt Street in Castroville.  After lunch, we will be going to California Succulents (Frank, Naomi , and Lisa Bloss) at 134 Trabing Road in Watsonville (831-722-1446).  (Directions at the end of this Courier.)

fmart ("What's Bugging You","Jim Daniel","The most interesting trip I made to Mexico was after the 1976 convention in El Paso, Texas.  In 1974 Bob Foster & Charley Glass rediscovered <I>Calabanus hookerii</I>.  They brought 6 plants back to the States and none for me.  I decided to go to Mexico to find my own. Bert Mueller was my traveling companion.  We traveled and collected to just south of San Louis Potosi.  We stopped for lunch and cleaned and packed plants.  A Mexican man pushing a bicycle with a cooler full of ice cream came by.  I asked him where he was going and he said to the village of Lourdes.  I took a peyote plant and placed a sprig of grass on it and asked if he knew where a plant like this grew?  He replied that yes it grew near the village of Santa Maria Del Rio.  I offered to buy his ice cream and throw his bicycle in the back of his truck and hire him to show me the location of the <I>Calibanus</I>.  He declined but stated that he would take the ice cream to Lourdes and return in two hours.  We had a truckload of plants to clean so we agreed.</P><P>Upon his return we loaded his bicycle in the truck and drove the four miles to his village and picked up one of his <I>companeros</I> in a local bar.  About a mile from town we came to a mountain so steep it was almost a cliff.  Bert was tired so he stayed with the truck.  I went with the other two and sure enough found the <I>Calibanus</I> growing in great profusion, from tiny little fellows to giants the size of a Volkswagen.  The legal limit for taking plants across the border was 12 inches.  We three soon filled our bags with <I>Calibanus</I> and wrestled them down the steep mountain.  My helpers quit.  They said that one trip was all that was expected of a man, to make more was the work of a burro.  I gave them $3.00 each (about 2 day's pay in Mexico at the time.)  I was the burro who went up the mountain two more times.  I figured I would need about a hundred plants for all my friends and customers.</P><P>A couple of days later we were camped at El Huzache Junction.  Bert was cleaning plants, a never-ending job on a collecting trip.  Any foliage on the tops of the plants had to be removed and the roots had to be pruned back to the body of the plant.  The body had to be brushed off to rid the plant of any insects.  The Department of Agriculture preferred to have the plants washed but most desert travelers did not have a surplus of water.  I have known some field collectors to spend the day at the beach washing all their plants.  (I never did this, as desert plants hate salt water.)  I left Bert and drove to the next village to see the headman.  I needed about 25 of <I>Astrophytum myriostgma var. potosina</I> and 10 <I>Astrophytum var. elongata</I>.  We agreed on a price, so I went back to the truck to help Bert.  Leaning against the truck was a short one-armed Mexican man, wearing a <I>pistole</I> and badge. He placed us under arrest and then did not know what to do.  He had to get us back to San Louis Potosi.  While he was mulling over the possibilities.  We heard a loud &quot;Halloo&quot; from the surrounding hills.  Much to the Policeman's surprise, the whole village of people that I had gone to see this morning had shown up with three burros, each loaded with two baskets of <I>Astrophytums</I>, each contained about fifty plants. At first, the cop told them it was illegal to pick and sell them.  They became very irritated and threatened his life with the many machetes they had with them.  He finally agreed for me to buy them, I agreed on a price with the headman even though it was many more than I agreed to buy earlier.  It was the easiest solution.  If I had pulled out my <I>pistole</I> from the truck to back the officer up, no telling which way it would have gone.</P><P>The cop said if I would haul him to San Louis Potosi, he would not include the <I>Astrophytums</I> or the items in the truck (including 100 <I>Calabanus</I>) but only the 13 boxes of plants Bert was cleaning and were outside of the truck when he arrived on the scene.  He also agreed that he would let us stay in the Cactus Motel and would help us find the American Consul in San Louis Potosi. This was on a Friday night and sounded like a good deal to me.</P><P>On Monday I appeared at the office of the Department of Agriculture with the American Consul who was Mexican too and spoke fluent Spanish.  After much rigmarole it was agreed that they would confiscate the 13 boxes of plants they knew about and I was free to go.  I waited until after dark and showed up at the impound lot.  Two Mexican fellows were on duty.  After a little discussion and the exchanging of $3.00 each, it was agreed that I would leave 13 partially filled boxes behind and sort them out so I could save the most valuable of the plants.  I sorted, picked up Bert from the Motel and headed for Tula.  I needed some <I>Neogomesa Agavoides</I>.");
