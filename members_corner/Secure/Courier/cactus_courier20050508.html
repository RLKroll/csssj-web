fmart ("Prez Sez","Bill Munkacsy","We have just completed another fine Show and Sale.  Things went like clockwork, and everybody there was a great help.  I really cannot think of any glitches that took place; everyone did so well.  I wish to use this venue to give everyone congratulations on a job well done; it went so very smoothly.  I would like to give special thanks, but I am afraid I would leave someone out, so suffice it to say everyone did wonderfully.</P><P>We were hurt badly by the loss of two vendors due to illness.  The buyers were there, but without their wares our sales dropped quite low this year.  We may want to think of having a second sale with a limited show so as to offset the poor performance.</P><P>The Monterey Bay club has two sales for just this reason.  Last year, they had a great spring sale, but the fall was a dud due to rain.  (Rain is predicted for their weekend sale.)  Something for us to think about as soon as possible.");

As much as I hate to say it, I think someone missed the boat on this one.  I kind of fail to see anything star like about it, instead I see a sea urchin without its spines.</P><P>Anyway, I have no problems growing this plant.  It is best to be careful on how often you water it.  I have also discovered that here in the Central Valley of California it wants to be watered several times over the winter.  This is not a heavy watering but enough to keep the plant from pancaking or going real flat.  In habitat, it gets winter rain.  Just go easy on it and have a fast draining soil.  I have not lost an <I>A. asterias</I> yet with winter watering.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><P>As for <I>Echinocereus dasyacanthus rectispinus</I>, the only thing we can see right off hand to say that it is different from <I>E. dasyacanthus</I> is the central spines.  Other differences are seed form, rib count, spine count and some other things that we have to have special tools to know about.</P><P>I know of no one that walks up to a sale table and starts counting ribs, radial and central spines to get the name of a plant. 99.999% look at the tag for the name.  To about all the collectors or growers one look and they know if a plant is named wrong.  I tell you from experience that some one that is not very well versed in the plant names and is selling, does not like to be advised that their plant names are wrong.</td><td valign='top'><TABLE><tr><td><img src='echinocereus dasyacanthus v rectispinus.jpg' width=320 height=240 hspace=0></td></tr><tr><td align='center'><font size=-2 color='#6699CC'><I>Echinocereus dasyacanthus rectispinus</I></font></td valign='top'></tr></TABLE></td></tr></TABLE></center>");

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado","Have you ever had one of those times when everything in your life is like backing into an agave?  My son, Jim, has never seen an agave that he hasn't known on a personal level.  They just seem to like him in an almost magnetic way.  So of course, in a rather perverted way, I find them fascinating.</P><P>&quot;No skill to growing them,&quot; you say.  Well, that may be part of their charm.  Even a person that hasn't had any luck in their garden can grow beautiful agaves. They range from the simple to the grand, from the easy to grow to the very complex and from the little-little to as big as a house. And who among us isn't impressed with the seed head of a century plant?  Be sure to really plan ahead if you choose to grow this one.  A little bit of research into the growth pattern might make you rethink your choice.</P><P>Who wouldn't love the plant that gave us tequila?  Tequila is an alcoholic drink made in the highlands of central Mexico from the distilled sap of the agave.  It's said that tequila is a gift from the gods.  The word &quot;agave&quot; comes from the Greek word for &quot;noble&quot;.  Although, I'm not sure that getting totally blasted on tequila is all that noble.  <I>Agave tequilana weber azul</I> (blue variety) is a succulent.  When people ask me if I'm a cactus lady, I say, &quot;No, I'm a succulent lady.&quot;  This isn't really true, because I have probably five times as many cactus as succulents, but it sounds cooler.</P><P>So, as you can see, the agave can be a source of enjoyment on many levels: and some of those enjoyments don't even involve my son bleeding.  And, if I've learned anything about the agave over the years it's that it is to be enjoyed, respected and maybe even feared.");
