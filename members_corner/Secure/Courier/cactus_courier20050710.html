<B class="leadhead">Favorite Plants and Why We Love Them</B><br>
<br>
<P>
This month, we will be exchanging stories about how and why we became involved with succulent plants.  Bring your favorite plant, a plant that has taxed your patience, or a plant about which you have a question.  Our more experienced members will be regaling us with tales of the early days of succulent plant collecting.  (Yes, they are that old.)  Younger members can take advantage of this opportunity to learn why that plant they cherished so attentively turned brown and shriveled into a ghastly imitation of itself.  This is your chance to enthrall your fellow enthusiasts with the details of how you raised that magnificent ribbon winner from a tiny seed or drugstore seedling.

fmart ("Grower's Garden","Elton Roberts","<center><TABLE cellpadding=8><tr><td colspan=2>Most people know the Grizzly Bear cactus, <I>Opuntia erinacea v. ursina</I>, from its long shaggy hair like spines.  The spines are usually white becoming gray in age.  I also have a red spined form.  Its spines also gray up in age.  (something like me.)  This plant is found over a wide range from California's Sierra Nevada east slope eastward to southwest Utah and down into Arizona.  The flowers can be either pink or the more common yellow.  Flower diameter is to 7 cm.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><br><TABLE><tr><td><img src='opuntia erinacea v ursina.jpg' width=320 height=240 hspace=0></td></tr><tr><td align='center'><font size=-2 color='#6699CC'><I>Opuntia erinacea v. ursina</I></font></td valign='top'></tr></TABLE></td><td valign='top'>Spine length is supposed to be up to 10 cm long.  I guess that one of my plants didn't know that for it had spines 20 cm long.  I do not remember now what happened, but I found one of my plants laying on its side.  I did not fight it as it had been laying over for some time.  In this position I could see the spines just fine.  I took a measurement and could not believe what I was seeing.  The plant had grown spines that were 53 cm long.  That is 21 inches long for us not in or use to the metric system. After doing the measuring, I cut about 10 inches off the spines so the plant and pot would stand up again.  This was one of the red spined plants.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><br><I>Opuntia aurea</I> keeps getting kicked back and forth from <I>O. aurea</I> to <I>O. basilaris v. aurea</I>.  I like sticking to the first for this plant grows quite differently from <I>O. basilaris</I>.  <I>O basilaris</I> grows in a clump where <I>O. aurea</I> grows in long chains.  These chains are up to 2.5 meters (8 feet) long or longer.  There is a yellow flower form and a red flower form.  According to the books, it comes from only northwest Arizona and adjacent southwest Utah.  Coming across Nevada, I also saw them.  They grow around and under juniper trees.  My plants have thicker pads than <I>O. basilaris</I>, and the stems are green and not the blue gray of <I>O. basilaris</I>.</td><td valign='top'><TABLE><tr><td><img src='opuntia aurea.jpg' width=320 height=240 hspace=0></td></tr><tr><td align='center'><font size=-2 color='#6699CC'><I>O. aurea</I></font></td valign='top'></tr></TABLE></td></tr></TABLE></center>");

fmart ("A Walkabout in CA, AZ, and NV <font size=3>(continued)</font>","Jim Daniel","The next day we attempted to drive across Davis Dam, but it was closed due to the fear of terrorists.  We drove up AZ # 93 to Boulder Dam.  We were warned that the road was closed to large trucks, was Sam's pickup a large truck?  We passed inspection just before the dam.  They are building a bypass about 1/2 a mile downstream for the traffic, but it will be a year or two before it is finished.  We crossed the dam, went through Las Vegas on Route # 95, and turned on Route #157 to the Charleston Mountains.  There were tons of <I>Yucca shidigera</I> and <I>Yucca baccata</I> beside the road.  We were on the search for <I>Agave utahensis v. eborispina</I>.  We took NV # 158 to Lee Canyon, no luck there.  We then drove to the Sheep Range of Mountains.  Found <I>Echinocereus mohavensis</I>, <I>E. engelmanii</I>, <I>Echinocactus polyancistrus</I>, <I>Ferocactus acanthoides</I>, <I>Yucca</I>, and <I>Opuntia</I> in great profusion.  The road became very rough, so we decided to attack from a different direction.  We drove back to Las Vegas, Took 1-15 to NV #93 north to Pahranagat Lake, and turned west onto a dirt track, which soon turned into a rock track.  We suffered in silence for about 10 miles.  We drove back to Las Vegas and spent another night in a casino. The advantage of that, it is economical, the rooms are clean, the shower water is hot, and the gaming tables are too, if you are so inclined.  The disadvantage is there is a tremendous amount of walking involved.  You walk from the casino parking to your room, from your room you walk through the gaming tables in search of a restaurant.  For a person with worn out legs its too much walking.</P><P>We took NV #160 towards Pahrump and stopped to see Red Canyon National Park.  It was a beauty, a large sandstone reef surrounded by limestone cliffs.  It had evidence of early man habitations; caves and <I>Agave</I> fire pits.  It was as handsome as Capitol Reef in Utah.  We took the scenic drive and stopped at the visitor center.  Very impressive!  Then we pushed on to Pahrump.  When we arrived and turned at west at NV 372 over the Nopah Range of Mountains.  This is another home for <I>Agave utahenses v. eborispina</I>.  Once again we struck out.  We turned south at Shoshone on CA #127 and on into Baker.  We turned east on I-15 and went to Cima Dome.  Here is a large forest of <I>Yucca brevifolia v. jaegeriana</I> plus many <I>Opuntia ramosissima</I>, <I>O. acanthocarpa</I>, <I>O. echinocarpa</I>, <I>O. erinacea v. ursina</I>, <I>Echinocereus mojavensis</I>, <I>Ferocactus acanthoides</I>, and <I>Agave utahensis v. nevadensis</I>.  We made a tour of the valley and surrounding hills then back to Baker for our Motel room.  We had a little tire problem next morning then took off for home.  All and all, we had a fine time, and it was five days portal to portal.  It's time to break the monotony and hit the road.");
