<P>
The January program will be a presentation by Naomi Bloss on how to stage plants for competition showing.
</P>
<P>
Please bring a plant you want to prepare to enter in our annual show.
</P>
<P>
A potting medium (no charge) will be available.  Top dressing, surplus plants from our Holiday party, will be available for sale, as will some of our club's surplus plants.  Participants also should try to bring some rocks, weathered wood, etc. to include in the presentation.  Although the staging represents a small percentage (5% - 10%) of the total points in judging, that's enough to produce a winner in a close race.
</P>
<P>
Even if you don't plan to show your plants in competition, it's nice to give them a treat and present them to yourself and friends in the best possible way.  (Think mini-show.)
</P>
<P>
The Bloss's California Succulents will be providing some of their marvelous plants for sale, too.

fmart ("Prez Sez'","Bill Munkacsy","Happy New Year to all.  What a wonderful Christmas party, it was fun and not dragged out.  Everyone had a fun time.  Now off to a fun and prosperous new year.  It is pouring rain as I write.  Lets try to get away from this all to a drier climate by working with our plants and preparing them for the show.  We would like all, especially beginners, to show their plants, especially their best, to promote the club and hobby.  How better to get things started than to have Naomi give a hands on demonstration on staging this coming meeting.  Also, it would be a good time to ask any questions you may have on your own plants.  If you have doubts or reservations on showing, bring your pot and plant for pointers.  I am sure we all can help. Lets all have a fun time at this.  Remember, this is the time of year most cactus want to stay dry (as best they can with the weather), but your winter growing succulents need to be watered and cared for.");

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado","Have you ever noticed that it isn't always what you say, but how you say it?  Some words can be thought of as negative even thought they really aren't negative words.  Let's take a look at some of these of words.</P><P>&quot;Common&quot; can mean a variety of things: popular, familiar, prevalent and usual.  On the other side, it can mean ordinary or occurring frequently or habitually.  (Kind of like in the common cold.)  Most of us start out with &quot;common&quot; plants until we have a good idea of what we are doing and then move on to the more specialized plants.  It's just common sense, right?</P><P>&quot;Simple&quot; is another word that can mean many things.  Okay, we all know that being called simple is not the nicest of compliments.  But, if you're being called unassuming or unpretentious that's not such a bad thing.  A jade plant is a fairly &quot;simple&quot; plant to grow, but just look at them when they bloom in your front yard and try to tell me that they aren't beautiful plants.</P><P>&quot;A take charge kind of person&quot; can be the person that can always be relied on to see that a job gets done.  Examples can be generals, presidents and the natural born leaders.  On the other side of the coin, are the pushy kind that have to get their way on everything.  (I have a tendency to fall into this category, sorry.)  We have some in our club that are &quot;take charge kind of people&quot; that we just couldn't survive without.  This group of people help to run the club, brings in the refreshments, organize the show and sale, put out the newsletter and step forward to take care of countless other club duties.</P><P>So, this simple, common, take charge kind of person would like you all to know that I appreciate all of you; thorns and all. It's the variety of not just the plants, but the people in the club that make me keep coming back every month.  Thanks for another great year and here's to many more!");
