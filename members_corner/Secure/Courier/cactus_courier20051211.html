<P>
This year's Holiday Banquet will be held on December 11, 2005, from 11:00am to 4:00pm at Harry's Hoffbrau.  The restaurant is located at 390 Saratoga Avenue near Kiely Boulevard.  Their number is 408-243-0434.

<P>
Everyone who brings a plant puts it on the center table for the plant exchange.  A club officer will select the best plant which will be added to the auction plants.  The person who brought that plant is the first to select from the exchange.  Whoever brought the plant the first person picked picks next, and so forth until all the plants have been taken.  When all the plants are gone, the last person selects a plant from the gift plants.
</P>
<P>
As announced in last month's Courier, there will be two categories of plants for the auction: plants under $20 and plants over $20.  For the plants under $20 the first person bidding $20 will get the plant.  The auction in this area will be silent; there will be a card next to the plant in which people will bid on the plant.  When time is up, only the top three bidders will be able to bid on the plant. Again the first person to bid $20 will get the plant.  This will be explained at the Christmas dinner so don't worry if you don't understand it now.  The plants over $20 will be handled the same way; only on both categories there will be a minimum bid that will be listed and bidding will start from the minimum bid.  Hopefully these changes will speed along the process and bidding.
</P>
<P>
Members who renew at or before the December meeting will participate in a special plant raffle.

We would like those who would be interested in receiving their courier online to voice this wish to Rich Kroll.  If he can accomplish this, he will try to do so.  This would save the club roughly $5 a year for each member in postage, which we could consider reimbursing in some way like a free plant etc.");

Some are easy rules that don't even take much thought, while others can be very difficult.</P><P>There are rules that we seem to know without anyone ever teaching us.  There are rules that we need to be taught.  There are rules that can never be broken and there are rules that can be bent.  It's up to us all to sort through the rules and decide which ones fall into which category.  Sometimes we need guidance from our friends to help us with these decisions.</P><P>I'm amazed by the rules that we all seem to know without ever having been told.  You all know what I'm talking about, the basic rules of life.  These are the rules that make us able to live in a community without killing each other.

Probably half of my collection has been given to me from my friends in our society.  Many of these friends are like family.  But, I would never, ever take a cutting or offset without permission.
