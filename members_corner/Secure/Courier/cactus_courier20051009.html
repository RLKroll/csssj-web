<P>
Our next meeting is for everyone.  We hope all members will attend.  We will discuss basic information on plants and plant growing.  There will be plenty of time for questions and to help members with their plants.  Hope to see you there.
</P>
<P>
<font size=-1>(See page 2 for more details on the program. Ed.)</font>
</P>
<P>
Even though the weather is beautiful and your plants are growing and looking great it is the time to start getting ready for winter.  This means cutting back on water, curtailing fertilizer, and finding a spot to move your plants in to winterize.   Some plants, especially those from the Southern Hemisphere, tend to grow now and need water and fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
Know your plants. Some will need to be protected from excessive winter rain, some need protection from freezing.  Any questions you have, the next meeting is your opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The end of the year marks the most fun meeting of the year and by far the best meeting any club has, the Christmas extravaganza.  Remember it will be the 2nd Sunday of the month this year; mark it down now.  We will have member gift exchange, plant giveaway for members renewing and new members, and our auction where you can really get the gift you want by buying it yourself for your most favorite person, yourself.  The plant giveaways are of quality plants that make it foolish not to join.  They are worth more than membership price, and there are quality plants in the auction for one and all.  I am still kicking myself for not buying a few that were available last year.  Get yourself ready and mark that date down.
</P>

So, I am usually at a loss to know how to properly display my plants for show.  I feel that this is a real chance for me to get an advanced opportunity to learn more about how to stage plants from proven winners.  (How about you?)  Our February meeting in 2006 will be dedicated to a hands-on exercises in plant staging for our annual show.");

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado","There seem to be two types of people in the world: collectors and the ones that wish they were collectors.</P><P>We all know who the collectors are. They're the ones that are easy to shop for because they're always interested in adding to their collection.  They usually don't feel the need to &quot;limit&quot; themselves because there is always room for one (or ten) more. They often end up as the butt-end of a joke because of it.  In other words, they're just about everyone that I have ever called &quot;friend.&quot;</P><P>There are people that try to be collectors.  They say that they collect cookbooks but only have two books.  They talk endlessly about art work by some obscure artist and yet they don't even own one of the pieces.  They say they collect cactus and have only one plant.</P><P>I'm talking about <I>real</I> collectors.  You know the ones, the type that has everything to do with the selected subject.  In my case: cactus.  I have shirts with cactus all over them.  I have salt and pepper shakers in the shape of a saguaro plant.  I have picture frames made in the image of a cactus desert.  The pictures in my bathroom have the cactus motif.  If you go into my house or yard, you will know beyond a doubt that I am a cactus collector.  The signs are everywhere.</P><P>Now, I don't want you to start thinking that I'm a Howard Hughes type of collector.  I do know the difference between collecting and hoarding.  It's just that sometimes the line between healthy collecting and down-right nuts gets a little bit fuzzy.  I did draw the line when my mom gave me a rubber saguaro to put on the antenna of my car.  I'd like to say that I thought it was over the top, but I was really afraid that someone might steal it.</P><P>It always surprises me when people think me odd.  Some even feel the need to tell me.  But, I just tell them, &quot;I'm not odd. I'm a collector.&quot;");

fmart ("Two or three day trip to the Mojave Desert","Jim Daniel","I strongly recommend a trip to Joshua Tree National Monument.  This is the desert at its finest.  From the huge, old full sized <I>Yucca brevifolia</I> at the higher altitudes will dwarf you and your vehicle to the <I>Coypantha alversonii</I>, a handsome plant and one of the most difficult to grow in cultivation, <I>Echinocereus engelmanii</I>, <I>E. mohavensis</I>, <I>Fouquieria splendens</I>, <I>Oputia ramosissima</I>, <I>O. bigelovii</I>, <I>O. acanthocarpa</I>, <I>O. echinocarpa</I>, and <I>O. basilaris</I>. The <I>Ferocactus acanthoides</I> grow around the park in great profusion. The finest stand I ever found is up the Interstate Route 10 a few miles past the south entrance to the Park, the first large pumping station that takes the Colorado River water to Los Angeles.  It has numerous &quot;Keep Out&quot; signs on the dirt roads leading to the canyon. With the threats to National Security, I imagine it would take a pair of brass balls to go up there today.  The Park has access on the north side at Yucca Valley and 29 Palms.  The southern entrance is easy driving from Palm Springs and Indio.  There are several Casinos around Indio, if you care to gamble with your money.  I find it is more fun to spend your cash at a Cactus Nursery.  You have something to show for it when you get back home.");
