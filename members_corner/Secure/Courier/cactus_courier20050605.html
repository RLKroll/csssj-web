<br>
<P>
Brian Kemble will be presenting a program on the Summer Rainfall region of South Africa at our June meeting.  He photographed <I>Aloe</I>, <I>Gasteria</I>, <I>Hawathia</I>, and <I>Euphobia</I> species in their natural habitats in the Southern and Eastern Cape including the Little Karoo Desert.
</P>
<P>
Brian has presented to our group on numerous occasions, but, according to Bill Kurtz, this is his best program yet.
</P>
<P>
For this trip, he traveled with Ernst van Jaarsfeld, a premier South African horticulturist well known for his extensive exploration of areas not usually open to nature photographers.

The name is mentioned in Benson's &quot;The Cactus of the US and Canada&quot;.  There is no information on it there though.   The joints are small only about 6 x 6 cm and 1.5 cm thick. They are blue gray in color.  The joints are more or less heart shaped.  The areoles only have glochids except for the base joint that has 3 to 5 fine spines up to 1 cm long.  These few spines are medium tan as are the glochids.  On new joints, the glochids are white, and there is one green leaf that is recurved over the glochids.  This leaf soon drops off.  The flower is to 5 cm across.  My largest plant is only about 15 cm tall (6&quot;).</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><br>From around Mendosa, Argentina, comes <I>Pterocactus fischeri</I>.

fmart ("Master of None","Linda Delgado","When I joined our club many years ago, I was so excited about my new club that I wanted to share it with everyone that I loved.   It didn't really matter that they didn't have the same interests as I do.  They should become involved to please me.</P><P>My mom was dragged to a couple of meeting and had a nice time, but she really isn't the club type.  She tries to make it to our show and sale at least every couple of years, and she manages to buy a trunk load of plants.</P><P>My son, Jim, is a member.  He has a hard time sitting through a whole meeting, and when the lights go out so does he.  He enjoys coming to our show and sale, and he even has a small aloe collection.  I think the pot-luck/barbeque holds the most interest for him.</P><P>My son, Roy, let's just say, is a little bit more of a challenge.  It isn't that Roy doesn't like my friends.  He has grown rather fond of many of them.  He thinks that the guy that looks like Jerry Garcia is cool.  (You all know who I'm talking about!)  He enjoys talking to anyone about <I>Haworthias</I>.  (He even has some.)  And, he'll pitch in and help even though he would rather stay at home playing video games or watching TV on his day off.</P><P> &quot;So, what is the problem?&quot; you ask.  The problem is that I want them to want to be involved.  I want them to ask me when the next meeting is and what they can do to help out.  I want them to get excited, when I bring home a new plant, and I want them to go happily to the gravel pit to pick out rocks.  In short, I want them to do everything that I want them to do.  It's not all that big of a request considering that I'm willing to go with them to countless KISS concerts and Nascar races.</P><P>On second thought, maybe things are fine the way they are.");

fmart ("A Walkabout in CA, AZ, and NV","Jim Daniel","Sam Keeton and I took a little ride this last April, if you could call any ride with Sam &quot;little&quot;.  Sam is a bold and fearless driver.  We drove down Interstate #5 and turned East on State 58 to Barstow.  We encountered loads of wild flowers.  Some of the succulents we saw were <I>Opuntia basilares v. treleaseii</I> in the Caliente River on the East side of Bakersfield, <I>Yucca whippeii</I> just before the summit of Tehachapi Pass, and <I>Yucca brevifolia</I> on the East side of the Pass.  We traveled over the Mojave Desert marveling over the short fences put up to protect the Desert Tortoises from the traffic.  We arrived in Barstow well before dark and decided to spend the night there.</P><P>The next day, we took Interstate #40 towards Needles.  We passed tons of <I>Opuntia acanthcarpa</I>, <I>O. bigleovii</I>, <I>O. ramissima</I>, <I>Ecinocactus Polycephala</I>, <I>Ferocactus acanthides</I>, and <I>Echinocereus engilmanii</I>.  It was an ancient volcano field, so there were lots on interesting rock formations.  At Needles, we turned South on Ca. Route 95, and we saw more of the same as we drove to Parker Dam.  They cleared thousand of <I>Carnagia gigantea</I> in the 1930's when they built the dam.  You can still see some of these giants planted along the streets of Yucca Valley and Twentynine Palms.  An interesting plant in this area is <I>Echinocerus engelmanii v. munzii</I>.</P><P>We crossed a bridge over the Colorado River a few miles below the Parker Dam and entered the Arizona version of the Rivera, big homes shoulder to shoulder set into the bluffs over the river.  We took AZ Route #95 North, passed through Lake Havasu City until we hit Interstate #40, turned East, went to Yucca, and turned south again. We drove out on the desert on a dirt road for 20 miles or so.  We found some of the <I>Canagia gigantia</I> that they missed at Parker Dam.  We drove through Kingman, turned west to Laughlin, Nevada, and spent the night in a Casino.");
