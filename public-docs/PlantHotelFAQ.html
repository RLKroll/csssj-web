<h3 id="what’stheplanthotel">What’s the plant hotel?</h3>

<p>A place to temporarily store boxes full of plants you plan to purchase.</p>

<h3 id="whywouldiuseit">Why would I use it?</h3>

<p>Most likely because you’ve filled a box, but haven’t finished shopping, and would like to keep looking without having to carry — and juggle — multiple boxes. Or maybe you’d like to step out to lunch, or run a quick errand, or… you get the idea.</p>

<h3 id="howdoesitwork">How does it work?</h3>

<p>You bring us one or more boxes. We place a uniquely-numbered ticket in each box, place the box in our storage area, and hand you the other half of each ticket.</p>

<p>When you’re ready to reclaim your boxes, just hand us your tickets, and we’ll retrieve the corresponding boxes for you.</p>

<h3 id="oneticketperbox">One ticket per box?</h3>

<p>Yes. We sometimes have to move boxes around to make the best use of space; giving each box its own ticket helps us keep it from getting lost.</p>

<h3 id="howmuchdoesitcost">How much does it cost?</h3>

<p>Nothing. It’s completely free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="canileavemyboxesovernight">Can I leave my boxes overnight?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, no. Since the Plant Hotel resides outside the building, there’s no way for us to lock it down and keep your selections safe.</p>
